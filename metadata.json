To update this file, make\r\n## a commit or pull request at https://github.com/journalovi/jovi-workflows\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Set up Github pages\r\n   - [x] If the paper requires compilation:\r\n      - [x] Ensure it has a workflow file, such as `.github/workflows/publish.yml`, that compiles the paper and copies the compiled result to the root folder of the `gh-pages` branch. Some example workflow files:\r\n         - [Quarto](https://github.com/journalovi/jovi-template-quarto/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yml)\r\n         - [Idyll](https://github.com/journalovi/2024-Cashman-PAC-learning-game/blob/master/.github/workflows/publish.yml) - this template can be easily adapted for other workflows that use custom tools for building, e.g. npm or yarn, by swapping out the `npm` commands and ensuring the correct output folder is copied to the `gh-pages` branch in the last step.\r\n      - [x] Go to **Settings -> Pages**:\r\n         - [x] Set \"Source\" to \"Deploy from a branch\"\r\n         - [x] Set \"Branch\" to \"gh-pages\"\r\n         - [x] Set the folder to \"/\"\r\n      - [x] Verify the compilation works. On the repo page, go to Actions and click on the \"XXX Publish\" (XXX = Quarto/Idyll/etc) workflow on the left, then click Run Workflow and run it.\r\n   - [x] Verify that the \"pages build and deployment\" action is successful.\r\n   - [x] Check that the live version of the article is visible at http://www.journalovi.org/20XX-YY-ZZ (replace the last part with the repo name).\r\n- [x] Ensure the paper contains a notice infobox at the top that the paper is under review and that the repository links in the notice are correct (by replacing the `20xx-repo-name` part with the repository name).\r\n\r\n   In Quarto this looks like:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   ::: {.callout-important appearance=\"simple\"}\r\n   ## Under Review {.unnumbered}\r\n   This paper is [under review](https://www.journalovi.org/under-review.html) on the experimental track of the [Journal of Visualization and Interaction](https://www.journalovi.org/).

See the <a href=\"https://github.com/journalovi/20xx-repo-name/issues\">reviewing process</a>.</p>\r\n   ```\r\n   - [x] In the info box, ensure “20xx-repo-name” is replaced with the name of the repository so that the link points to the Issues page on Github.\r\n   - [x] Check that the live version of the paper now has the infobox in it with the correct links. You may need to go to the Actions page to check that the build process has completed, then go back to the live paper URL. You might need to reload the article without cache (In Chrome: Cmd + Shift + R (Mac) or Ctrl+ Shift + R (Windows)).\r\n- [x] Compare the paper with the authors’ compiled version that the authors submitted. Sample the figures and interactive elements to see if they are present and work in the same way.\r\n- [x] ~~Check that the article works locally without an internet connection:~~ moved to #22 \r\n   - [x] Check out the repo and switch to whatever branch serves the site (e.g. `main` or `master` for sites without compilation, `gh-pages` for sites with compilation).\r\n   - [x] With the internet off (e.g. in airplane mode), ensure the page loads in a browser. Sample the figures and interactive elements to see if they are present and work in the same way. You may need to use a local server from the repo directory:\r\n         \r\n      ```sh\r\n      python -m http.server\r\n      ```\r\n- [x] From the [main repo page](../), click the settings gear icon next to \"About\" on the right. (If you cannot see the “About” section, make your web browser window wider.)\r\n   - [x] Under \"Description\" enter \"UNDER REVIEW\"\r\n   - [x] Under \"Website\" tick \"Use Your Github Pages Website\".\r\n   - [x] Click “Save changes”\r\n- [x] Edit README.md and add the following at the very top:\r\n   ````\r\n   ```diff\r\n   ! This paper is under review on the experimental track of the Journal of Visualization and Interaction.\r\n   Authors: [insert Github IDs]\r\n   OC: TBD\r\n   AE: TBD\r\n   R1: TBD\r\n   R2: TBD\r\n   R3: TBD\r\n   ```\r\n   ````\r\n- [x] Replace `[insert Github IDs]` in `README.md` with the authors' Github IDs.\r\n- [x] When an OC has been assigned to this paper, replace the `TBD` under `OC:` in `README.md` with the Github ID of the OC.\r\n- [x] Enable branch protection on the repository:\r\n   - [x] Under Settings -> Branches, click \"Add branch protection rule\"\r\n   - [x] Under \"Branch name pattern\", enter \"main\" or \"master\" (whichever applies to this repo)\r\n   - [x] Click \"Create\"\r\n   - [x] Check that the newly-created rule says \"Currently applies to 1 branch\" next to it.\r\n- [x] Ensure that the authors have write access to the repo:\r\n   - [x] Under Settings -> Collaborators and Teams, click \"Add people\"\r\n   - [x] Enter the Github usernames for each author as provided by the authors. Give each one \"Write\" access.\r\n- [x] Re-render [under-review.qmd](https://github.com/journalovi/journalovi.github.io/blob/main/under-review.qmd) on the JoVI website (See instructions in the source code). Ensure that the added paper is listed on the [Under Review](https://www.journalovi.org/under-review.html) page in the correct location.\r\n- [x] When this checklist is complete, create the following issues and tag the relevant people (Github IDs are listed on [People page](https://www.journalovi.org/people.html)), then close this issue:\r\n   - [x] [Recruit Associate Editor](new?assignees=&labels=pre-review&projects=&template=91_tech_org-recruit_editor.md&title=%5BPRE-REVIEW%5D+Recruit+Associate+Editor) (assign to the OC of this paper) (**NOTE:** this part of the process may change as we evolve the Editor-Wrangler role)\r\n   - [x] [Open Materials Review](new?assignees=&labels=review&projects=&template=92_tech_open-review.md&title=%5BREVIEW%5D+Open+Materials+Review) (assign to the Open Practices Chair)\r\n   - [x] [Accessibility Review Request](new?assignees=&labels=pre-review&projects=&template=93_tech_acc-review_request.md&title=%5BPRE-REVIEW%5D+Accessibility+Review+Request) (assign to the Accessibility Chair)\r\n",

So long as it works via a local server, with all resources served from that local server, we can be a little more confident in an article's longevity...",

To update this file, make\r\n## a commit or pull request at https://github.com/journalovi/jovi-workflows\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Set up Github pages\r\n   - [x] If the paper requires compilation:\r\n      - [x] Ensure it has a workflow file, such as `.github/workflows/publish.yml`, that compiles the paper and copies the compiled result to the root folder of the `gh-pages` branch. Some example workflow files:\r\n         - [Quarto](https://github.com/journalovi/jovi-template-quarto/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yml)\r\n         - [Idyll](https://github.com/journalovi/2024-Cashman-PAC-learning-game/blob/master/.github/workflows/publish.yml) - this template can be easily adapted for other workflows that use custom tools for building, e.g. npm or yarn, by swapping out the `npm` commands and ensuring the correct output folder is copied to the `gh-pages` branch in the last step.\r\n      - [x] Go to **Settings -> Pages**:\r\n         - [x] Set \"Source\" to \"Deploy from a branch\"\r\n         - [x] Set \"Branch\" to \"gh-pages\"\r\n         - [x] Set the folder to \"/\"\r\n      - [x] Verify the compilation works. On the repo page, go to Actions and click on the \"XXX Publish\" (XXX = Quarto/Idyll/etc) workflow on the left, then click Run Workflow and run it.\r\n   - [x] Verify that the \"pages build and deployment\" action is successful.\r\n   - [x] Check that the live version of the article is visible at http://www.journalovi.org/20XX-YY-ZZ (replace the last part with the repo name).\r\n- [x] Ensure the paper contains a notice infobox at the top that the paper is under review and that the repository links in the notice are correct (by replacing the `20xx-repo-name` part with the repository name).\r\n\r\n   In Quarto this looks like:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   ::: {.callout-important appearance=\"simple\"}\r\n   ## Under Review {.unnumbered}\r\n   This paper is [under review](https://www.journalovi.org/under-review.html) on the experimental track of the [Journal of Visualization and Interaction](https://www.journalovi.org/).

See the <a href=\"https://github.com/journalovi/20xx-repo-name/issues\">reviewing process</a>.</p>\r\n   ```\r\n   - [x] In the info box, ensure “20xx-repo-name” is replaced with the name of the repository so that the link points to the Issues page on Github.\r\n   - [x] Check that the live version of the paper now has the infobox in it with the correct links. You may need to go to the Actions page to check that the build process has completed, then go back to the live paper URL. You might need to reload the article without cache (In Chrome: Cmd + Shift + R (Mac) or Ctrl+ Shift + R (Windows)).\r\n- [x] Compare the paper with the authors’ compiled version that the authors submitted. Sample the figures and interactive elements to see if they are present and work in the same way.\r\n- [x] ~~Check that the article works locally without an internet connection:~~ moved to #22 \r\n   - [x] Check out the repo and switch to whatever branch serves the site (e.g. `main` or `master` for sites without compilation, `gh-pages` for sites with compilation).\r\n   - [x] With the internet off (e.g. in airplane mode), ensure the page loads in a browser. Sample the figures and interactive elements to see if they are present and work in the same way. You may need to use a local server from the repo directory:\r\n         \r\n      ```sh\r\n      python -m http.server\r\n      ```\r\n- [x] From the [main repo page](../), click the settings gear icon next to \"About\" on the right. (If you cannot see the “About” section, make your web browser window wider.)\r\n   - [x] Under \"Description\" enter \"UNDER REVIEW\"\r\n   - [x] Under \"Website\" tick \"Use Your Github Pages Website\".\r\n   - [x] Click “Save changes”\r\n- [x] Edit README.md and add the following at the very top:\r\n   ````\r\n   ```diff\r\n   ! This paper is under review on the experimental track of the Journal of Visualization and Interaction.\r\n   Authors: [insert Github IDs]\r\n   OC: TBD\r\n   AE: TBD\r\n   R1: TBD\r\n   R2: TBD\r\n   R3: TBD\r\n   ```\r\n   ````\r\n- [x] Replace `[insert Github IDs]` in `README.md` with the authors' Github IDs.\r\n- [x] When an OC has been assigned to this paper, replace the `TBD` under `OC:` in `README.md` with the Github ID of the OC.\r\n- [x] Enable branch protection on the repository:\r\n   - [x] Under Settings -> Branches, click \"Add branch protection rule\"\r\n   - [x] Under \"Branch name pattern\", enter \"main\" or \"master\" (whichever applies to this repo)\r\n   - [x] Click \"Create\"\r\n   - [x] Check that the newly-created rule says \"Currently applies to 1 branch\" next to it.\r\n- [x] Ensure that the authors have write access to the repo:\r\n   - [x] Under Settings -> Collaborators and Teams, click \"Add people\"\r\n   - [x] Enter the Github usernames for each author as provided by the authors. Give each one \"Write\" access.\r\n- [x] Re-render [under-review.qmd](https://github.com/journalovi/journalovi.github.io/blob/main/under-review.qmd) on the JoVI website (See instructions in the source code). Ensure that the added paper is listed on the [Under Review](https://www.journalovi.org/under-review.html) page in the correct location.\r\n- [x] When this checklist is complete, create the following issues and tag the relevant people (Github IDs are listed on [People page](https://www.journalovi.org/people.html)), then close this issue:\r\n   - [x] [Recruit Associate Editor](new?assignees=&labels=pre-review&projects=&template=91_tech_org-recruit_editor.md&title=%5BPRE-REVIEW%5D+Recruit+Associate+Editor) (assign to the OC of this paper) (**NOTE:** this part of the process may change as we evolve the Editor-Wrangler role)\r\n   - [x] [Open Materials Review](new?assignees=&labels=review&projects=&template=92_tech_open-review.md&title=%5BREVIEW%5D+Open+Materials+Review) (assign to the Open Practices Chair)\r\n   - [x] [Accessibility Review Request](new?assignees=&labels=pre-review&projects=&template=93_tech_acc-review_request.md&title=%5BPRE-REVIEW%5D+Accessibility+Review+Request) (assign to the Accessibility Chair)\r\n",

This is needed for archiving purposes per #21.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it looks like the use of observable.js means this paper cannot be rendered fully standalone at this time. I think we'll have to live with that limitation for the time being (observable being an obvious approach for interactivity in articles), and hope that https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/1412 is fixed at some point in the future. @cscheid would appreciate any thoughts you have.",

			"body": "Hi all (and particularly @codementum @nickelm) --- \r\n\r\nWe recently went through a process of taking everything we've learned so far on the experimental track and using it to refine the templates we use for issues (such as initial setup, reviews, meta-reviews, etc). We have also codified an additional position, \"Tech Chair\", which is @journalovi/tech-chair (currently filled by me). This position is responsible for tech setup on experimental track repos, so that AEs are not burdened with this.\r\n\r\nAs part of these changes, I am in the process of updating the state of each experimental track repository to reflect our newly-refined workflows. The [issue templates in this repo](new/choose) have already been updated, as they are now updated automatically. I am going to be creating some new issues and renaming / editing some old issues in order to get things to a consistent state. This should mostly not require any new work from all of you, but I will mention you on any relevant issues if there is something that you need to do.\r\n\r\nOnce I am done, I will close this issue.",

Perhaps it is the colon in the citation key?\r\n\r\n- As it stands, the paper is on track to be published with 3 endorsements and 1 possible endorsement / undendorsement. These decisions will be included in the published paper, along with links to the review threads.\r\n    - Reviewer (issue #7, @joviewer-xyz) will have to decide if they want to endorse, endorse with reservations, or unendorse.\r\n    - If the reviewer does not pick an unqualified \"endorse\", the authors will have to decide if they want to publish at this time, or make additional changes to the paper. \r\n\r\nFinally, I would like to acknowledge that I agree with the outstanding request (i.e., the simulation/user study requested in #7). That said, I also believe the paper in it’s current form makes worthwhile contributions that others can learn and build from.\r\n\r\n### Decision\r\n\r\nEndorse: I am willing to endorse this paper, with at most minor copyediting.\r\n",

That said, I also believe the paper in it’s current form makes worthwhile contributions that others can learn and build from.\r\n\r\nThank you. I took @joviewer-xyz's comment to mean that *either* a simulation study *or* applying the definitions in a computational manner would be sufficient to address this point. I will await the reviewer's word on this matter.\r\n\r\n> ### Decision\r\n> Endorse: I am willing to endorse this paper, with at most minor copyediting.\r\n",

			"body": "Thanks @nickelm for the continued careful effort to improve the paper. The added and modified sections are welcome changes that do serve to address some of my criticisms and requests. \r\n\r\nFollowing @codementum 's question: i would have strongly preferred there to be a simulation study (which was an aspect of my requested changes)---or another user study---to address some of the open questions. However, given the repeated emphasis that no substantial changes can be added to the work (cf the declined request for a slider on a particular figure) it seems like unlikely that any additional requests, such as the aforementioned simulation study, will be heeded. \r\n\r\n**So, with that in mind I offer an \"endorse with reservations\" judgement.** In my view, this work could be stronger if additional work was done to improve it, but it is of a borderline-acceptable quality in its current state. There is value in the work (for instance the comparison of jitter with a bespoke method is a nice standalone result), and publishing the work with its current content would support that value (although many questions remain open).",

			"body": "Starting a new issue for discussion on this, since it may also requiring weighing in from the OC (cc @floe @chatchavan @lonnibesancon).\r\n\r\n@nickelm thanks for the careful response and archaeological work here. Because of our commitment to research transparency, I think at a journal level we want to be sure we're setting the right standard. \r\n\r\nMaybe it would help our discussion if you could provide a list of what materials exist for the paper and what are missing? Then we could discuss specific cases more easily.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n(original comment on #1 copied below)\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\n              > ensure all appropriate supplemental materials are included: e.g. experimental data, experimental analysis code, source code for artifacts, etc. For a full list of requirements see the transparency section of the author guide\r\n\r\nThis is well received. In response, I have collected further material from my coauthors and uploaded the available files and protocols to OSF (https://osf.io/bk9cx/). However, as noted by several reviewers, this is an older project that was completed some time ago; in fact, the study was run in 2014. Both students who participated in the project have moved on to faculty careers of their own. The students have all provided all available files, but it is not complete. I have uploaded what I was able to recover. I hope that this article's value supersedes its weaknesses in research transparency.\r\n\r\nThe analysis for the study data was recently updated in preparation for this submission and is available. I have uploaded it to the OSF as `bootstrap.html`. Note, however, that this is an interactive JavaScript application designed to be run with an active user. The Vega JSON files it generates for producing the SVG plots were already to be found in the `plots/` folder.\r\n\r\n> check they are in appropriate long-term repositories (e.g. OSF, Zenodo, etc). Github repositories are okay as long as they are also archived on something like OSF or Zenodo. One easy way to archive + DOI an existing github repo is with Zenodo; see here\r\n\r\nI have added the GitHub repository to the OSF (https://osf.io/bk9cx/). I will create a registration at the end of the major revision process (and after additional future revisions).\r\n\r\n> check they are listed in the abstract and the required Materials section of the paper\r\n\r\nThe OSF is indeed listed in the abstract (under Materials).\r\n\r\n> if any materials are missing, create an issue tagging the authors and ask them to add those materials\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if anything is still missing.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @nickelm in https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/1#issuecomment-1913734783_\r\n            ",

Atom seems to have an overlapping set of authors, and because JoVI emphasizes rigor over novelty, this approach would be appropriate. For example, are there any core ideas that Gatherplots explored that were generalized in Atom, or approaches that did not make it? Such a retrospective could prove particularly useful for readers while also addressing review issues with novelty claims in the paper as written.\r\n\r\nThere are several other considerations in individual reviews that should be weighed in revising the novelty of the work.\r\nFor example, [#7](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/7) mentions the scatterplot task typology from Sarikaya and Gleicher, while [#16](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/16) sees possible comparisons to Rzeszotarski and Kittur.\r\nI encourage the authors consider suggestions in the individual reviews in the revision, as well.\r\n\r\n## Algorithm Specifics\r\nReviews raise specific concerns about the algorithmic and mathematical details of the work.\r\n[#15](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/15) gives suggestions for clarifying the bin sizing approach.\r\n[#7](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/7) provides several suggestions on the mathematics and geometry of the approach.\r\n[#16](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/16) suggests reducing the mathematical notation to avoid confusion.\r\nAuthors might consider several routes to addressing these concerns, either through strengthening/defending the notations or by tightening/transforming them, e.g. changing to natural language.\r\n\r\n## Evaluation Improvements\r\nReviews also mention possible improvements to the evaluation.\r\nSee [#15](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/15) for several suggestions, including a need for a few additional experiment details and open materials (also a main issue, below).\r\n[#16](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/16) also provides suggestions such as adding additional competitors, or at least discussing how the technique relates to competitors.\r\nTwo approaches may suffice here. Either existing claims and writing could be tightened and made more precise, or new experiments could be added to satisfy claims as they currently are given in the paper. \r\n\r\n## JoVI-required Materials\r\nReviews noted that evaluation materials such as the experiment code, data, and analysis scripts were not available.\r\nAs including such materials are part of JoVI guidelines, these should be included in a revision.\r\nIn particular, these would help with reviewers such as [#15](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/15) who were attempting to replicate the experiment analysis.\r\n\r\n## GatherLens Clarification\r\nThe GatherLens component appears to be an addition to the core of the work.\r\nReviews were generally not positive about its relation to the core GatherPlot narrative.\r\nOne possible way of including it in the submission, however, would be to clearly specify that GatherLens is meant to be a demonstration of how GatherPlots can be composed and used in practice, rather than claiming the GatherLens as a core contribution in itself.\r\n\r\n## Accessibility Review + Changes\r\nThe accessibility review in issue [#6](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/6) highlights several needed and several optional changes for the submission.\r\nIn general, aspects that would impede accessibility on a Desktop should be addressed.\r\nThese include having desktop legible font sizes, especially for figures.\r\nThe submission figures could be improved in this regard.\r\nAll images should also have appropriate alt text.\r\n\r\nOther suggestions, such as label density, are optional as they are not necessarily needed to describe the purpose of the graph.\r\nIn other words, some visualizations may be illustrating the technique, rather than meaning to show the underlying data and axis values.\r\n\r\nFinally, some suggestions may be limitations of the Quarto platform itself. These do not need to be addressed at this time as they may be difficult or impossible to fix.\r\n\r\nDecision: Major Revision\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

For example, are there any core ideas that Gatherplots explored that were generalized in Atom, or approaches that did not make it?

We have addressed each of these concerns from individual reviews in turn.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** We have improved the background section and the comparison to prior art. In particular, we have added more recent missing work from our initial writing of this article.\r\n\r\n> Algorithm Specifics\r\n> Reviews raise specific concerns about the algorithmic and mathematical details of the work.\r\n> #15 gives suggestions for clarifying the bin sizing approach.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** We have added details on bin sizing.\r\n\r\n> #7 provides several suggestions on the mathematics and geometry of the approach.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** We have discussed and adopted these suggestions.\r\n\r\n> #16 suggests reducing the mathematical notation to avoid confusion.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** We have removed the unnecessary mathematical formalism and replaced it with natural language.\r\n\r\n> Authors might consider several routes to addressing these concerns, either through strengthening/defending the notations or by tightening/transforming them, e.g. changing to natural language.\r\n\r\nThese were all good points of feedback, and I believe that I have addressed them all. \r\n\r\n> Evaluation Improvements\r\n> Reviews also mention possible improvements to the evaluation.\r\n> See #15 for several suggestions, including a need for a few additional experiment details and open materials (also a main issue, below).\r\n\r\n**Revision:** Fixed.\r\n\r\n> #16 also provides suggestions such as adding additional competitors, or at least discussing how the technique relates to competitors.\r\n\r\nWe opted not to do this; see our response in issue #16. \r\n\r\n> Two approaches may suffice here. Either existing claims and writing could be tightened and made more precise, or new experiments could be added to satisfy claims as they currently are given in the paper.\r\n\r\nWe have opted for the latter, improving the writing and claims as well as the reporting of the results.\r\n\r\n> JoVI-required Materials\r\n> Reviews noted that evaluation materials such as the experiment code, data, and analysis scripts were not available.\r\n> As including such materials are part of JoVI guidelines, these should be included in a revision.\r\n> In particular, these would help with reviewers such as #15 who were attempting to replicate the experiment analysis.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** Thanks for your patience; I believe that I have added all of the required materials to the OSF. (I still need to register the GitHub files, but will only do this once my final changes are pushed.)\r\n\r\n> GatherLens Clarification\r\n> The GatherLens component appears to be an addition to the core of the work.\r\n> Reviews were generally not positive about its relation to the core GatherPlot narrative.\r\n> One possible way of including it in the submission, however, would be to clearly specify that GatherLens is meant to be a demonstration of how GatherPlots can be composed and used in practice, rather than claiming the GatherLens as a core contribution in itself.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** I ended up dropping both the section and the contribution. I am somewhat enamored by the application, but since there is no interactive version to demonstrate it may be best left outside the paper.\r\n\r\n> Accessibility Review + Changes\r\n> The accessibility review in issue #6 highlights several needed and several optional changes for the submission.\r\n> In general, aspects that would impede accessibility on a Desktop should be addressed.\r\n> These include having desktop legible font sizes, especially for figures.\r\n> The submission figures could be improved in this regard.\r\n> All images should also have appropriate alt text.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** I am working with the accessibility reviewer/editor to fix this. I submitted one revision and will tackle the updates soon.\r\n\r\n> Other suggestions, such as label density, are optional as they are not necessarily needed to describe the purpose of the graph.\r\n> In other words, some visualizations may be illustrating the technique, rather than meaning to show the underlying data and axis values.\r\n\r\nSounds good, thank you.\r\n\r\n> Finally, some suggestions may be limitations of the Quarto platform itself. These do not need to be addressed at this time as they may be difficult or impossible to fix.\r\n\r\nUnderstood.\r\n\r\n> Decision: Major Revision\r\n\r\nThank you for the careful feedback from both the editor and the individual reviewers. Also thank you for your patience. I hope this new version will be a step closer.\r\n",

			"body": "### Conflicts of interest\n\n- [X] I declare that I have no known conflicts of interest with the authors.\n\n### Reviewed version\n\n0ee8b81\n\n### Review\n\n###### Short Summary\r\n\r\nThis paper presents Gatherplot, a variant of conventional scatterplot that alleviates the overplotting problem. By “gathering” and “packing” the data points in the scatterplot, users can more easily and accurately examine grouped objects. The Gatherplot system was evaluated through a crowdsourced experiment conducted on the Amazon Mturk Platform, where the results indicate Gatherplot’s superiority against the jittering solution. The paper ends by introducing Gatherlnes, a focus+context solution utilizing Gathering. \r\n\r\n###### Verdict\r\n\r\nThis paper presents an interesting visualization technique and the technique is rigorously validated through a large-scale crowdsourced user study. However, the paper currently holds several limitations (see major and minor weaknesses), and there exist questions on the novelty of the proposed system. Therefore, the paper currently needs substantial revision before publishing. Thus, the final decision is **Major revision**.\r\n\r\n###### Paper Strength\r\n\r\n**(S1) Well-designed experiment**\r\nThe paper includes rigorous experiments using the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. Due to its crowdsourced nature, the study results seem to be more credible. Despite there being some missing points in the study design (Check Weakness), the study is overall well-designed and executed.\r\n\r\n**(S2) Interactive figures**\r\nI liked using the interactive figures provided in the paper. I especially liked Figure 2, which interactively demonstrates the potential problems in scatterplots. It really helped me gain an initial understanding of the problem domain.\r\n\r\n\r\n###### Paper Major Weakness\r\n\r\n**(W1) Question on Novelty**\r\nThe major weakness of the paper is that the proposed visualization system, which is Gatherplot, seems to have negligible novelty compared to previous works like Atom [2] or Kinetica [1]. Especially, except for GatherLens, the Gatherplot system seems to be almost identical to Atom Grammar. The paper should more precisely and explicitly describe the contribution of this paper, which differentiates it from previous papers. \r\n\r\n**(W2) The Background section is two wordy and lacks connection to the proposed work**\r\nIn the background section, there exists a list of methods that alleviate overplotting problems (e.g., appearance-based method, distortion-based method). However, the section is overwhelming (too many works listed), and the section also lacks connection to the proposed work. The paper should include how each type of method is related to the design of Gatherplot, and discuss the pros and cons of each type. This is especially important as the only competitor used in this paper is jittering. \r\n\r\n**(W3) Section 3 (Gather transformation) is too complex and hard to understand**\r\nThe description of the gather transformation, incorporating mathematical formulas, is hard to understand and seems to be unnecessarily complex. The mathematical notations are not reused, and the formulas are not referenced in the following sections.  It would be better to explain the process in natural language, along with descriptive figures. \r\n\r\n**(W4) The experiment needs more competitors**\r\nThough rigorously designed, the experiment needs to add more competitors. This limitation is also connected to W2. As the background section contains a rich set of previous works alleviating the overplotting, they should be included as competitors. Some of them are even easy to implement (e.g., transparency), so they can be easily added to the experiment. \r\n\r\n**(W5) The experiment results lack discussions**\r\nThe experiment results section should be more elaborate in terms of adding more interpretations and discussions. For example, when reporting the interaction effect, there needs to be following discussions on the effect and reasoning of the interaction effect. \r\n\r\n**(W6) GatherLens needs evaluation**\r\nThe GahterLens seems to be an interesting contribution, which adds substantial novelty to the paper (so that the paper can overcome W1). However, GatherLens itself needs a short evaluation that can confirm its usability. Maybe a simple usage scenario can help?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###### Paper Minor Weaknesses\r\n\r\n**(M1)** In the Background – Data-aware Methods section, the paper claims that “Gatherplot requires no such balancing”, which differentiates it from Keim et al. [3]. Is this truly an advantage? It seems that there exists a natural tradeoff between distortion and overlapping. Is it even possible to remove such balancing?\r\n\r\n**(M2)** To facilitate the understanding of potential readers, it would be nice to illustrate how previous works (Background section) alleviate overlapping issues using figures. \r\n\r\n**(M3)** Interval tick Marks → The paper is saying that the bracket is used because “it uses minimal ink and creates less density with adjacent ticks”. However, it seems not to be sufficient justification. Moreover, (f) seems to use more ink compared to (a), (d), and (e). Actually, I think the description of tick marks and its justification is better to be removed from the paper, as it incorporates minor design choices.\r\n\r\n**(M4)** Personal interest: it would be better for Gatherplot to have the functionality to split groups into subgroups, enabling details-on-demand exploration of hierarchical data. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###### References\r\n\r\n[1] Rzeszotarski, Jeffrey M., and Aniket Kittur. \"Kinetica: Naturalistic multi-touch data visualization.\" Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. 2014.\r\n\r\n[2] Park, Deokgun, et al. \"Atom: A grammar for unit visualizations.\" IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics 24.12 (2017): 3032-3043.\r\n\r\n[3] Keim, Daniel A., et al. \"Generalized scatter plots.\" Information Visualization 9.4 (2010): 301-311.\r\n\n\n### Openness/Transparency\n\nThe source code of the system is provided. However, the repository (https://github.com/intuinno/gatherplot) lacks detailed documentation. Still, the repository contains the way to run the project. I also appreciate that the online demo is provided. Overall, the openness and transparency of this system are not perfect, but they are still at a sufficient level to be published and announced. \r\n\n\n### Submission categories\n\n- [ ] Registered Report\n- [ ] Replication Study\n- [X] Empirical Research - Quantitative\n- [ ] Empirical Research - Qualitative\n- [X] Systems or design research\n- [ ] Commentary\n- [ ] Systematic Literature Review\n\n### Suggested outcome\n\nMajor revisions: this paper requires substantial improvements that I will need to re-review to decide whether or not to endorse it.\r\n\n\n### Requested changes\n\nIt would be great to see the next version in which all major and minor weaknesses are revised. At least the limitations listed in major weaknesses should be revised for publication. \r\n\n\n### ORCID\n\n_No response_",

Atom seems to have an overlapping set of authors, and because JoVI emphasizes rigor over novelty, this approach would be appropriate. For example, are there any core ideas that Gatherplots explored that were generalized in Atom, or approaches that did not make it? Such a retrospective could prove particularly useful for readers while also addressing review issues with novelty claims in the paper as written.\r\n\r\nThere are several other considerations in individual reviews that should be weighed in revising the novelty of the work.\r\nFor example, [#7](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/7) mentions the scatterplot task typology from Sarikaya and Gleicher, while [#16](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/16) sees possible comparisons to Rzeszotarski and Kittur.\r\nI encourage the authors consider suggestions in the individual reviews in the revision, as well.\r\n\r\n## Algorithm Specifics\r\nReviews raise specific concerns about the algorithmic and mathematical details of the work.\r\n[#15](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/15) gives suggestions for clarifying the bin sizing approach.\r\n[#7](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/7) provides several suggestions on the mathematics and geometry of the approach.\r\n[#16](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/16) suggests reducing the mathematical notation to avoid confusion.\r\nAuthors might consider several routes to addressing these concerns, either through strengthening/defending the notations or by tightening/transforming them, e.g. changing to natural language.\r\n\r\n## Evaluation Improvements\r\nReviews also mention possible improvements to the evaluation.\r\nSee [#15](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/15) for several suggestions, including a need for a few additional experiment details and open materials (also a main issue, below).\r\n[#16](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/16) also provides suggestions such as adding additional competitors, or at least discussing how the technique relates to competitors.\r\nTwo approaches may suffice here. Either existing claims and writing could be tightened and made more precise, or new experiments could be added to satisfy claims as they currently are given in the paper. \r\n\r\n## JoVI-required Materials\r\nReviews noted that evaluation materials such as the experiment code, data, and analysis scripts were not available.\r\nAs including such materials are part of JoVI guidelines, these should be included in a revision.\r\nIn particular, these would help with reviewers such as [#15](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/15) who were attempting to replicate the experiment analysis.\r\n\r\n## GatherLens Clarification\r\nThe GatherLens component appears to be an addition to the core of the work.\r\nReviews were generally not positive about its relation to the core GatherPlot narrative.\r\nOne possible way of including it in the submission, however, would be to clearly specify that GatherLens is meant to be a demonstration of how GatherPlots can be composed and used in practice, rather than claiming the GatherLens as a core contribution in itself.\r\n\r\n## Accessibility Review + Changes\r\nThe accessibility review in issue [#6](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/6) highlights several needed and several optional changes for the submission.\r\nIn general, aspects that would impede accessibility on a Desktop should be addressed.\r\nThese include having desktop legible font sizes, especially for figures.\r\nThe submission figures could be improved in this regard.\r\nAll images should also have appropriate alt text.\r\n\r\nOther suggestions, such as label density, are optional as they are not necessarily needed to describe the purpose of the graph.\r\nIn other words, some visualizations may be illustrating the technique, rather than meaning to show the underlying data and axis values.\r\n\r\nFinally, some suggestions may be limitations of the Quarto platform itself. These do not need to be addressed at this time as they may be difficult or impossible to fix.\r\n\r\nDecision: Major Revision\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

			"body": "> Verdict\r\n> This paper presents an interesting visualization technique and the technique is rigorously validated through a large-scale crowdsourced user study. However, the paper currently holds several limitations (see major and minor weaknesses), and there exist questions on the novelty of the proposed system. Therefore, the paper currently needs substantial revision before publishing. Thus, the final decision is Major revision.\r\n\r\nThanks for the careful feedback. I hope that this new revision will address all the weaknesses.\r\n\r\n> Paper Strength\r\n> (S1) Well-designed experiment\r\n> The paper includes rigorous experiments using the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. Due to its crowdsourced nature, the study results seem to be more credible. Despite there being some missing points in the study design (Check Weakness), the study is overall well-designed and executed.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n> (S2) Interactive figures\r\n> I liked using the interactive figures provided in the paper. I especially liked Figure 2, which interactively demonstrates the potential problems in scatterplots. It really helped me gain an initial understanding of the problem domain.\r\n\r\nThank you. We are excited about this work as an interactive article.\r\n\r\n> Paper Major Weakness\r\n> (W1) Question on Novelty\r\n> The major weakness of the paper is that the proposed visualization system, which is Gatherplot, seems to have negligible novelty compared to previous works like Atom [2] or Kinetica [1]. Especially, except for GatherLens, the Gatherplot system seems to be almost identical to Atom Grammar. The paper should more precisely and explicitly describe the contribution of this paper, which differentiates it from previous papers.\r\n\r\nAll fair points. Obviously, Atom is our own work, even though Gatherplots preceded it and led to the formulation of the Atom grammar. However, we think there is a clear innovation here as the present paper focuses in particular on a specific research problem, presents the visual design, and evaluates the new technique compared to jittering scatterplots. We have added such wording to the paper.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** We have clarified the distinction in a direct comparison at the end of the subsection titled \"Data-aware Methods\".\r\n\r\nThe point about Kinetica is well-taken. I was very aware of Kinetica, but always thought of it primarily as a forerunner for touch-based visualization as well as physical interaction for data visualization. Even if the focus of Kinetica is more on the natural data exploration using touch, there are clear parallels to gatherplots.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** We have added a citation to Rzeszotarski and Kittur (2014) and compared it to gatherplots at the end of the Background section.\r\n\r\n> (W2) The Background section is two wordy and lacks connection to the proposed work\r\n> In the background section, there exists a list of methods that alleviate overplotting problems (e.g., appearance-based method, distortion-based method). However, the section is overwhelming (too many works listed), and the section also lacks connection to the proposed work. The paper should include how each type of method is related to the design of Gatherplot, and discuss the pros and cons of each type. This is especially important as the only competitor used in this paper is jittering.\r\n\r\nI hear this feedback loud and clear. In response, I have removed the initial subsection titled \"Characterizing Overplotting\" on the basis that it was too basic and generally unnecessary.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** We have reduced the Background section by eliminating the \"Characterizing Overplotting\" subsection.\r\n\r\n> (W3) Section 3 (Gather transformation) is too complex and hard to understand\r\n> The description of the gather transformation, incorporating mathematical formulas, is hard to understand and seems to be unnecessarily complex. The mathematical notations are not reused, and the formulas are not referenced in the following sections. It would be better to explain the process in natural language, along with descriptive figures.\r\n\r\nThis is very true. Other reviewers have noted the same.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** We have eliminated unnecessary formalism and replaced it with natural language. In response, the Gather section is much shorter and easier to read.\r\n\r\n> (W4) The experiment needs more competitors\r\n> Though rigorously designed, the experiment needs to add more competitors. This limitation is also connected to W2. As the background section contains a rich set of previous works alleviating the overplotting, they should be included as competitors. Some of them are even easy to implement (e.g., transparency), so they can be easily added to the experiment.\r\n\r\nWe are unable to add to the experiment, as the original students have long since graduated and left. While we agree that additional techniques would have been useful, we believe that the existence of the jittering condition is a fair baseline comparison.\r\n\r\n> (W5) The experiment results lack discussions\r\n> The experiment results section should be more elaborate in terms of adding more interpretations and discussions. For example, when reporting the interaction effect, there needs to be following discussions on the effect and reasoning of the interaction effect.\r\n\r\nThanks for this feedback, it is very valid. \r\n\r\n**Revision:** We have added a Discussion section and populated it with these types of findings.\r\n\r\n> (W6) GatherLens needs evaluation\r\n> The GahterLens seems to be an interesting contribution, which adds substantial novelty to the paper (so that the paper can overcome W1). However, GatherLens itself needs a short evaluation that can confirm its usability. Maybe a simple usage scenario can help?\r\n\r\nWe appreciate the point. We were also quite enamored by the GatherLens example. However, based on this and other reviewer feedback, we have opted to remove it from the paper entirely.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** The GatherLens section has been removed and is no longer claimed as a contribution.\r\n\r\n> Paper Minor Weaknesses\r\n> (M1) In the Background – Data-aware Methods section, the paper claims that “Gatherplot requires no such balancing”, which differentiates it from Keim et al. [3]. Is this truly an advantage? It seems that there exists a natural tradeoff between distortion and overlapping. Is it even possible to remove such balancing?\r\n\r\n**Revision:** The reviewer is correct. We have reformulated this passage.\r\n\r\n> (M2) To facilitate the understanding of potential readers, it would be nice to illustrate how previous works (Background section) alleviate overlapping issues using figures.\r\n\r\nWhile this is a good idea and we entertained it, we found no good presentation for such a diversity of techniques. Thus, we opted not to do this for now.\r\n\r\n> (M3) Interval tick Marks → The paper is saying that the bracket is used because “it uses minimal ink and creates less density with adjacent ticks”. However, it seems not to be sufficient justification. Moreover, (f) seems to use more ink compared to (a), (d), and (e). Actually, I think the description of tick marks and its justification is better to be removed from the paper, as it incorporates minor design choices.\r\n\r\nThe point about ink is true; we have revised it to merely refer to \"tick mark density\". However, we have opted to keep the tick mark description in the paper since it adds to practical design aspects of the gatherplot technique.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** We have revised the discussion about tick mark ink.\r\n\r\n> (M4) Personal interest: it would be better for Gatherplot to have the functionality to split groups into subgroups, enabling details-on-demand exploration of hierarchical data.\r\n\r\nThis is good feedback, but it is currently out of scope for our gatherplots implementation. We would point to the Dataopsy technique (Hoque & Elmqvist 2024; now cited), that supports some of this functionality.\r\n\r\n> Openness/Transparency\r\n> The source code of the system is provided. However, the repository (https://github.com/intuinno/gatherplot) lacks detailed documentation. Still, the repository contains the way to run the project. I also appreciate that the online demo is provided. Overall, the openness and transparency of this system are not perfect, but they are still at a sufficient level to be published and announced.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate this feedback. Unfortunately, the original gatherplot implementation has been abandoned by the student and cannot be updated.\r\n\r\n> Major revisions: this paper requires substantial improvements that I will need to re-review to decide whether or not to endorse it.\r\n\r\n> Requested changes\r\n> It would be great to see the next version in which all major and minor weaknesses are revised. At least the limitations listed in major weaknesses should be revised for publication.\r\n\r\nExcellent, thank you. We believe we have addressed all of the major weaknesses and most of the minor ones. We appreciate the reviewer's careful feedback.\r\n",

			"body": "***Due to unknown reasons, I am currently not able to access the original account that I used to write the initial review. I thus created an alternative account (will report to editors)***\r\n\r\n## Round 2 Decision\r\n\r\n**Minor revisions:** this paper requires some smaller changes, after which I am confident I would be able to endorse it.\r\n\r\n## Verdict\r\n\r\nI would like to thank the authors for carefully addressing all the comments that I raised. I found that most of the serious concerns that existed in the initial document have been appropriately revised. I especially appreciate the authors for revising Section 3 (Gather transformation), which made the section much easier to understand and follow. I think that the paper will be ready for publication if only a few of the remaining weaknesses are addressed (Please see the weaknesses below; I tried my best to only tackle the weaknesses related to the ones that I previously raised). These weaknesses seem to be minor. Therefore, my decision is **minor revision**.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Weaknesses\r\n\r\n(W1) Still – why only “jitter”?\r\nI understand that it is hard to add more competitors to the experiment. I would not like to force authors to add competitors. Still, the reason why “only adding jittering as a baseline” is a valid experimental setting should be explained in detail. Without an explanation, potential readers may raise questions about the validity of the experimental setting.\r\n\r\n(W2) Tick mark description – why not alternatives?\r\nThe reason why another alternative design of tick marks is not selected should be explained in detail. I think the current description is still not convincing enough to justify the selection of the final design. This part needs more description. Also, it will be great to add how the alternative designs are selected.\r\n\r\n(W3) Relation with Atom\r\nThank you for adding Kinetica as related work and positioning the difference. Still, the relation with “Atom” grammar should be described in more detail. If the proposed system *led to the formulation of Atom grammar”, in my humble opinion, such fact should also be noted. This is because the paper will anywhere be published ***after*** Atom paper. Therefore, readers may incorrectly think that Gatherplots is a future work of Atom (due to their chronological relation). To avoid such misinterpretation, the relationship with Atom should be detailed.\r\n",

			"body": "> ### Weaknesses\r\n> (W1) Still – why only “jitter”? I understand that it is hard to add more competitors to the experiment. I would not like to force authors to add competitors. Still, the reason why “only adding jittering as a baseline” is a valid experimental setting should be explained in detail. Without an explanation, potential readers may raise questions about the validity of the experimental setting.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** Thanks for this feedback. We have expanded the motivation in the \"Experimental Design\" subsection to carefully discuss all major classes of techniques and add rationale for the choice.\r\n\r\n> (W2) Tick mark description – why not alternatives? The reason why another alternative design of tick marks is not selected should be explained in detail. I think the current description is still not convincing enough to justify the selection of the final design. This part needs more description. Also, it will be great to add how the alternative designs are selected.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** We have revised this section as well as the associated figure caption. The new treatment includes no unmotivated claims on visual clutter, and also discusses the origins of the given alternatives.\r\n\r\n> (W3) Relation with Atom Thank you for adding Kinetica as related work and positioning the difference. Still, the relation with “Atom” grammar should be described in more detail. If the proposed system *led to the formulation of Atom grammar”, in my humble opinion, such fact should also be noted. This is because the paper will anywhere be published _**after**_ Atom paper. Therefore, readers may incorrectly think that Gatherplots is a future work of Atom (due to their chronological relation). To avoid such misinterpretation, the relationship with Atom should be detailed.\r\n\r\nThat the Gatherplots project led to the development of the Atom grammar is, in fact, already described in the paper (in a footnote). You can find the footnote in the last paragraph of the \"Data-aware Methods\" subsection. We hope that this note is sufficient for the reviewer.\r\n",

Perhaps it is the colon in the citation key?\r\n\r\n- As it stands, the paper is on track to be published with 3 endorsements and 1 possible endorsement / undendorsement. These decisions will be included in the published paper, along with links to the review threads.\r\n    - Reviewer (issue #7, @joviewer-xyz) will have to decide if they want to endorse, endorse with reservations, or unendorse.\r\n    - If the reviewer does not pick an unqualified \"endorse\", the authors will have to decide if they want to publish at this time, or make additional changes to the paper. \r\n\r\nFinally, I would like to acknowledge that I agree with the outstanding request (i.e., the simulation/user study requested in #7). That said, I also believe the paper in it’s current form makes worthwhile contributions that others can learn and build from.\r\n\r\n### Decision\r\n\r\nEndorse: I am willing to endorse this paper, with at most minor copyediting.\r\n",

			"body": "### Conflicts of interest\n\n- [X] I declare that I have no known conflicts of interest with the authors.\n\n### Reviewed version\n\n0ee8b81\n\n### Review\n\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nThe authors present Gatherplot, a unit visualization technique that packs marks within partitions and avoids overplotting. I think Gatherplot is a useful technique for solving a common problem, but this paper requires more work in refining the contribution and improving the validity of the design and the study.\r\n\r\n## Knowledge\r\n\r\nI hope that the authors make their knowledge contribution clearer to make this paper a successful submission.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"744\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/assets/139520904/ba8f6c34-7640-4ebb-8210-5c4bf53a2e0c\">\r\n\r\nThe expressiveness of Gatherplot appears to be a subset of the ATOM grammar [Park et al. (2018)], so the knowledge added is not immediately clear. The two papers even share similar figures (see figure above). What the authors can do is to more explicitly compare Gatherplot and ATOM and outline new knowledge added (like more details on algorithms, design decisions, and iterations) or how they are different. Currently, ATOM is only cited in passing and the comparison is hard. Alternatively, the authors can reflect on how Gatherplot evolved into ATOM if that is the case. Then the knowledge contribution might turn into \"lessons in designing a visualization grammar\".\r\n\r\nIn addition, this paper is on the older side. A version of it is a technical report from 2016 (cited in ATOM), and the most recent references listed were from 2018. What new and relevant knowledge have we (vis community) gained about unit visualizations and remedying over plotting for the last 5 years? \r\n\r\nGiven how similar Gatherplot and ATOM are and how old this manuscript is, the authors need to provide more context on Gatherplot to make the paper useful for readers today. \r\n\r\nThis paper also has a user study for evaluation. I have outlined some issues and ambiguities partly addressable with open materials, see Validity section below. Without revisions, the user study can't count towards sound knowledge yet. \r\n\r\n## Validity\r\n\r\n### Design\r\n\r\nThe sections discussing the design of Gatherplots could be improved with more details and justification:\r\n\r\nThe optimal bin size, an important feature of Gatherplot: \r\n- The authors list \"a heuristic to decide bin sizes for optimal space usage\" as a contribution, based on \"spatial accuracy and legibility\". I can understand legibility---the individual dots/marks should look distinct from each other. But the authors might want to explain what spatial accuracy is and how it is applicable in this context. In Figure 6, the authors state that (a) has better spatial accuracy. I assume that this accuracy means the deviation from the x-axis tick. But any deviation should fall within the appropriate x-axis segment from the gather transform, so is deviation still a major issue to optimize for? My concern is that there looks to be aliasing in Figure 6 despite being more \"accurate\"--- some dots appear to have been sorted into small bins/rows where the data is dense. The authors might want to consider how their bin size choice affects the perception of the data distribution. \r\n- To add to the validity of the bin size algorithm, I hope that the authors can summarize their approach. I found a function called `getOptimalBinSize()` from https://github.com/intuinno/gatherplot/blob/5d4e902d262986219e50b9624694789f0bb5f281/app/scripts/directives/gatherplot.js#L2253. The authors can turn it into a few sentences.\r\n    - A minor comment: Wilkinson proposed a single bin size but also said that \"a well-written dot plot program should automatically down-size dots when extreme overflow occurs\" (Wilkinson, 1999), which is what the Gatherplot algorithm does from my rough reading of the code.\r\n- The authors should address the fact that this variant of Gatherplot (categorical + continuous variables) is a type of dotplot (also called beeswarm). If applicable, the authors should consider citing more recent open-source dotplot implementations and comparing them to how Gatherplot works. \r\n    - Vega-Lite, Observable plot with a `smooth` option that mitigates aliasing https://observablehq.com/@uwdata/dot-plots\r\n    - ggplot2/ggdist dotplot that automatically picks the bin size depending on the aspect ratio https://osf.io/2gsz6\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"937\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/assets/139520904/717c17e5-c9a9-4765-8b7c-a40a4970eff2\">\r\n\r\nThe choice to use `Pack; Size : Count, Shared` instead of a bar chart layout\r\n- Figure 10 of the ATOM paper is a Gatherplot, with the ATOM spec `Pack; Size : Count, Shared`. With the same data, Figure 8(a) is a version without the `Pack` and resembles a faceted stacked bar chart. I hope that the authors address why they did not make the bar chart layout the default in Gatherplot: bar charts (even when filled with dots) encode values by position on a common scale, which *should be* more perceptually accurate than encoding with area (what Gatherplot does). Also, the subgroups of dots will share the same width/height on one dimension, making sub-group comparisons easier. \r\n\r\nMisc comments\r\n\r\n- In Figure 5, if I select `x-axis = Name`, the x-axis only has one segment \"VW rabbit custom\", while there are many more car names in this dataset, visible when selecting `color = Name`. Is this a bug or a design choice? \r\n- The \"Using the Gather Transformation\" section talks about parallel coordinates (with 1D coordinates) instead of scatterplots (2D). I find it difficult to follow without visuals or context, and the authors should add a figure or remove the section if it is not closely relevant to the rest of the paper. \r\n\r\n### Validity of the evaluation\r\n\r\nThe authors evaluate the \"effectiveness of Gatherplots\" \"with categorical vs. categorical variables\". The crowd-sourced experiment has a simple design (a positive) and the authors applied appropriate statistical tests. However, there are inconsistencies in the analysis and a lack of details, part of which might be addressed by more open materials on the experimental stimuli and analysis code.  \r\n\r\n\r\n**Study design**\r\n- The authors should provide more details on the exact wording of the tasks and the format of the question (number input or multiple choice etc). Were participants expected to count dots (and how many) to answer the questions? Does incorrect mean that e.g. the participants input 10 and the correct answer is 9? Perceptual studies often characterize accuracy through continuous variables (like the error measure in Cleveland & McGill, 1984), so do the authors have a particular reason for encoding responses as correct/incorrect instead of a continuous error measure? I think information on how the questions are designed can help readers assess the validity of this study.\r\n\r\n**The \"both\" condition**\r\n- The authors test a \"both\" condition where the participants can toggle between absolute and normalized mode. However, this condition is not included in the hypotheses, nor is it directly discussed in the accuracy analysis. The authors only report that the `Absolute * Relative` interaction is significant without follow-up analyses to interpret the interaction. Also, for the completion time measure, did people spend the most time in the \"both\" condition because they toggled between the modes (is this logged)? Casual users don't often take advantage of interactivity in visualizations. The authors might want to discuss whether the toggle is worth it given the completion time and accuracy performance. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Analysis**\r\n- My main issue is that I am unable to reproduce the reported statistics ($\\chi^2$, $F$, etc) and averages while the analysis should be pretty straightforward. Again, the authors should be more explicit about how they performed the analyses and provide analysis code given that Jovi advocates for transparency practices. \r\n    - For example, for Task 1, jitter condition, the authors report the average completion time to be 44.26s, but my analysis returns ~ 36.5s. Figure 12 also shows a mean < 40. The authors should resolve this discrepancy. \r\n    - The authors should describe how repeated measures are handled in their logistical regression. \r\n    - The authors state that \"gatherplots enable people to assess data distribution more quickly\" in the Abstract, but I could not find support for this in the analysis. The authors should double-check and/or modify their descriptions. \r\n\r\n**Interpretation of the results**\r\n- The authors should consider offering possible explanations of their results and design recommendations. Could gatherplot be better than jittering because the dots are in a rectangular layout and therefore easier to glance at or count? How should we use gatherplots given those experimental results? Having interpretations like these on top of a list of statistics can make this paper more useful and informative for future research.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Misc writing\r\n- The length of this paper is appropriate for its content, though I did suggest a few places where the authors could elaborate more. \r\n- Small things\r\n    - Section 1: \"...overlap is known as (or) in visualization\"\r\n    - Two paragraphs start with \"Finally\" in the \"Data-aware Methods\" section.\r\n\n\n### Openness/Transparency\n\nAs a condition for acceptance, I hope the authors can provide the stimuli, data analysis scripts, and any other applicable materials per the Jovi requirements https://www.journalovi.org/author-guide.html#transparency-requirements. \r\n\r\nThe CSV file for the experimental data matches the number of participants, conditions, and repeated trials described in the paper. The README describes the data columns well. I did not find the analysis scripts in the OSF link.\n\n### Submission categories\n\n- [ ] Registered Report\n- [ ] Replication Study\n- [X] Empirical Research - Quantitative\n- [ ] Empirical Research - Qualitative\n- [X] Systems or design research\n- [ ] Commentary\n- [ ] Systematic Literature Review\n\n### Suggested outcome\n\nMajor revisions: this paper requires substantial improvements that I will need to re-review to decide whether or not to endorse it.\r\n\n\n### Requested changes\n\n- Refine the knowledge contribution in the context of ATOM and potentially newer literature\r\n- Clarify the bin size algorithm and justify the packing layout decision \r\n- Provide experimental stimuli and data analysis scripts\r\n- Resolve analysis issues and elaborate on how analysis results translate to the practical use of gatherplots.\n\n### ORCID\n\n_No response_",

Atom seems to have an overlapping set of authors, and because JoVI emphasizes rigor over novelty, this approach would be appropriate. For example, are there any core ideas that Gatherplots explored that were generalized in Atom, or approaches that did not make it? Such a retrospective could prove particularly useful for readers while also addressing review issues with novelty claims in the paper as written.\r\n\r\nThere are several other considerations in individual reviews that should be weighed in revising the novelty of the work.\r\nFor example, [#7](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/7) mentions the scatterplot task typology from Sarikaya and Gleicher, while [#16](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/16) sees possible comparisons to Rzeszotarski and Kittur.\r\nI encourage the authors consider suggestions in the individual reviews in the revision, as well.\r\n\r\n## Algorithm Specifics\r\nReviews raise specific concerns about the algorithmic and mathematical details of the work.\r\n[#15](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/15) gives suggestions for clarifying the bin sizing approach.\r\n[#7](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/7) provides several suggestions on the mathematics and geometry of the approach.\r\n[#16](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/16) suggests reducing the mathematical notation to avoid confusion.\r\nAuthors might consider several routes to addressing these concerns, either through strengthening/defending the notations or by tightening/transforming them, e.g. changing to natural language.\r\n\r\n## Evaluation Improvements\r\nReviews also mention possible improvements to the evaluation.\r\nSee [#15](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/15) for several suggestions, including a need for a few additional experiment details and open materials (also a main issue, below).\r\n[#16](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/16) also provides suggestions such as adding additional competitors, or at least discussing how the technique relates to competitors.\r\nTwo approaches may suffice here. Either existing claims and writing could be tightened and made more precise, or new experiments could be added to satisfy claims as they currently are given in the paper. \r\n\r\n## JoVI-required Materials\r\nReviews noted that evaluation materials such as the experiment code, data, and analysis scripts were not available.\r\nAs including such materials are part of JoVI guidelines, these should be included in a revision.\r\nIn particular, these would help with reviewers such as [#15](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/15) who were attempting to replicate the experiment analysis.\r\n\r\n## GatherLens Clarification\r\nThe GatherLens component appears to be an addition to the core of the work.\r\nReviews were generally not positive about its relation to the core GatherPlot narrative.\r\nOne possible way of including it in the submission, however, would be to clearly specify that GatherLens is meant to be a demonstration of how GatherPlots can be composed and used in practice, rather than claiming the GatherLens as a core contribution in itself.\r\n\r\n## Accessibility Review + Changes\r\nThe accessibility review in issue [#6](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/6) highlights several needed and several optional changes for the submission.\r\nIn general, aspects that would impede accessibility on a Desktop should be addressed.\r\nThese include having desktop legible font sizes, especially for figures.\r\nThe submission figures could be improved in this regard.\r\nAll images should also have appropriate alt text.\r\n\r\nOther suggestions, such as label density, are optional as they are not necessarily needed to describe the purpose of the graph.\r\nIn other words, some visualizations may be illustrating the technique, rather than meaning to show the underlying data and axis values.\r\n\r\nFinally, some suggestions may be limitations of the Quarto platform itself. These do not need to be addressed at this time as they may be difficult or impossible to fix.\r\n\r\nDecision: Major Revision\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

			"body": "> The authors present Gatherplot, a unit visualization technique that packs marks within partitions and avoids overplotting. I think Gatherplot is a useful technique for solving a common problem, but this paper requires more work in refining the contribution and improving the validity of the design and the study.\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback. I have tried to address it exhaustively.\r\n\r\n> I hope that the authors make their knowledge contribution clearer to make this paper a successful submission.\r\n\r\n> The expressiveness of Gatherplot appears to be a subset of the ATOM grammar [Park et al. (2018)], so the knowledge added is not immediately clear. The two papers even share similar figures (see figure above). What the authors can do is to more explicitly compare Gatherplot and ATOM and outline new knowledge added (like more details on algorithms, design decisions, and iterations) or how they are different. Currently, ATOM is only cited in passing and the comparison is hard. Alternatively, the authors can reflect on how Gatherplot evolved into ATOM if that is the case. Then the knowledge contribution might turn into \"lessons in designing a visualization grammar\".\r\n\r\n**Revision:** We have clarified the distinction in a direct comparison at the end of the subsection titled \"Data-aware Methods\".\r\n\r\n> In addition, this paper is on the older side. A version of it is a technical report from 2016 (cited in ATOM), and the most recent references listed were from 2018. What new and relevant knowledge have we (vis community) gained about unit visualizations and remedying over plotting for the last 5 years?\r\n\r\n**Revision:** We have improved added missing references, and will add further ones for the third review.\r\n\r\n> Given how similar Gatherplot and ATOM are and how old this manuscript is, the authors need to provide more context on Gatherplot to make the paper useful for readers today.\r\n\r\nThis is a fair point.\r\n\r\n> This paper also has a user study for evaluation. I have outlined some issues and ambiguities partly addressable with open materials, see Validity section below. Without revisions, the user study can't count towards sound knowledge yet.\r\n> The sections discussing the design of Gatherplots could be improved with more details and justification:\r\n\r\n> The optimal bin size, an important feature of Gatherplot:\r\n> The authors list \"a heuristic to decide bin sizes for optimal space usage\" as a contribution, based on \"spatial accuracy and legibility\". I can understand legibility---the individual dots/marks should look distinct from each other. But the authors might want to explain what spatial accuracy is and how it is applicable in this context. \r\n\r\n**Revision:** We have added definitions to both legibility and spatial accuracy to the beginning of the \"Managing Continuous Variables\" subsection.\r\n\r\n> In Figure 6, the authors state that (a) has better spatial accuracy. I assume that this accuracy means the deviation from the x-axis tick. \r\n\r\nNo, it is the deviation from the y-axis tick, not the x-axis tick (since this is a one-dimensional gatherplot, the x position actually does not mean anything). We hope that the new definition of spatial accuracy will help clarify this point.\r\n\r\n> But any deviation should fall within the appropriate x-axis segment from the gather transform, so is deviation still a major issue to optimize for?\r\n> My concern is that there looks to be aliasing in Figure 6 despite being more \"accurate\"--- some dots appear to have been sorted into small bins/rows where the data is dense. The authors might want to consider how their bin size choice affects the perception of the data distribution.\r\n\r\nYes, this is exactly our point: Figure 6b does indeed yield aliasing, i.e. lower spatial accuracy, because the smaller chart size precludes the dots from being made smaller (because that would violate legibility).\r\n\r\n**Revision**: We have added a sentence noting this as an inherent weakness of unit visualizations.\r\n\r\n> To add to the validity of the bin size algorithm, I hope that the authors can summarize their approach. I found a function called getOptimalBinSize() from https://github.com/intuinno/gatherplot/blob/5d4e902d262986219e50b9624694789f0bb5f281/app/scripts/directives/gatherplot.js#L2253. The authors can turn it into a few sentences.\r\n\r\n**Revision**: Thanks for pointing this out. We have added this iterative search to the description.\r\n\r\n> A minor comment: Wilkinson proposed a single bin size but also said that \"a well-written dot plot program should automatically down-size dots when extreme overflow occurs\" (Wilkinson, 1999), which is what the Gatherplot algorithm does from my rough reading of the code.\r\n\r\n**Revision**: Thanks again---we have added this to the paper.\r\n\r\n> The authors should address the fact that this variant of Gatherplot (categorical + continuous variables) is a type of dotplot (also called beeswarm). If applicable, the authors should consider citing more recent open-source dotplot implementations and comparing them to how Gatherplot works.\r\n\r\nThis is a good point echoed by earlier reviews.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** We have added a discussion of stripcharts, stripplots, beeswarms, and swarmplots to the related work. \r\n\r\n> Figure 10 of the ATOM paper is a Gatherplot, with the ATOM spec Pack; Size : Count, Shared. With the same data, Figure 8(a) is a version without the Pack and resembles a faceted stacked bar chart. I hope that the authors address why they did not make the bar chart layout the default in Gatherplot: bar charts (even when filled with dots) encode values by position on a common scale, which should be more perceptually accurate than encoding with area (what Gatherplot does). Also, the subgroups of dots will share the same width/height on one dimension, making sub-group comparisons easier.\r\n\r\nAtom, as noted, is an evolution of gatherplots. We felt that combining bar charts inside a scatterplot would be potentially confusing.\r\n\r\n> In Figure 5, if I select x-axis = Name, the x-axis only has one segment \"VW rabbit custom\", while there are many more car names in this dataset, visible when selecting color = Name. Is this a bug or a design choice?\r\n\r\nThis is a bug; we're addressing it. Thanks for spotting it!\r\n\r\n> The \"Using the Gather Transformation\" section talks about parallel coordinates (with 1D coordinates) instead of scatterplots (2D). I find it difficult to follow without visuals or context, and the authors should add a figure or remove the section if it is not closely relevant to the rest of the paper.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** The parallel coordinate example was far-fetched; we have removed it.\r\n\r\n> Validity of the evaluation\r\n> The authors evaluate the \"effectiveness of Gatherplots\" \"with categorical vs. categorical variables\". The crowd-sourced experiment has a simple design (a positive) and the authors applied appropriate statistical tests. However, there are inconsistencies in the analysis and a lack of details, part of which might be addressed by more open materials on the experimental stimuli and analysis code.\r\n\r\nWe have tried to address this in the new revision. Our OSF repository has been updated. Unfortunately, as stated elsewhere, given the age of the study (2014?) and our student co-authors having departed for greener pastures, we have not been able to reconstruct everything.\r\n\r\n> Study design\r\n\r\n> The authors should provide more details on the exact wording of the tasks and the format of the question (number input or multiple choice etc). Were participants expected to count dots (and how many) to answer the questions? Does incorrect mean that e.g. the participants input 10 and the correct answer is 9? Perceptual studies often characterize accuracy through continuous variables (like the error measure in Cleveland & McGill, 1984), so do the authors have a particular reason for encoding responses as correct/incorrect instead of a continuous error measure? I think information on how the questions are designed can help readers assess the validity of this study.\r\n\r\nFair point. We have found the original survey and included it. As for the individual questions, we merely used correct/incorrect and no continuous error measure. I agree that a continuous measure would have been better.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** The OSF includes a full study as a PDF. The new Figure 11 shows an example of a trial.\r\n\r\n> The \"both\" condition\r\n\r\n> The authors test a \"both\" condition where the participants can toggle between absolute and normalized mode. However, this condition is not included in the hypotheses, nor is it directly discussed in the accuracy analysis. The authors only report that the Absolute * Relative interaction is significant without follow-up analyses to interpret the interaction. Also, for the completion time measure, did people spend the most time in the \"both\" condition because they toggled between the modes (is this logged)? Casual users don't often take advantage of interactivity in visualizations. The authors might want to discuss whether the toggle is worth it given the completion time and accuracy performance.\r\n\r\nThis is a fair point. We added the condition for completeness, but did not include it in the hypothesis since we felt that its use was amply covered by the individual absolute and normalized modes.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** We have added a paragraph to the new Discussion section on the \"both\" mode.\r\n\r\n> Analysis\r\n\r\n> My main issue is that I am unable to reproduce the reported statistics and averages while the analysis should be pretty straightforward. Again, the authors should be more explicit about how they performed the analyses and provide analysis code given that Jovi advocates for transparency practices.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** We have added the analysis scripts to the OSF. However, as the script is interactive, we cannot provide a direct replication. Hopefully, the reviewer will be able to validate the correctness of the analysis, however.\r\n\r\n> For example, for Task 1, jitter condition, the authors report the average completion time to be 44.26s, but my analysis returns ~ 36.5s. Figure 12 also shows a mean < 40. The authors should resolve this discrepancy.\r\n\r\nWell spotted, thank you. This was a mistake persisting from our very first analysis; not entirely sure why there was a discrepancy.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** We have recalculated all of the averages, redone the analysis, and updated the paper.\r\n\r\n> The authors should describe how repeated measures are handled in their logistical regression.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I do not have the answer to this question. Furthermore, the analysis scripts are no longer available. In response, I have removed the logistic regression and ANOVA results. I have also beefed up the interpretation of the confidence intervals and effect sizes.\r\n\r\nI have kept the Kruskal-Wallis tests for the perceived confidence metric because it is clear from the narrative that we used Bonferroni corrections to account for multiple comparisons. \r\n\r\n**Revision:** We have removed the logistic regression and ANOVA results from the analysis. We have instead added interpretation of effect sizes and confidence intervals.\r\n\r\n> The authors state that \"gatherplots enable people to assess data distribution more quickly\" in the Abstract, but I could not find support for this in the analysis. The authors should double-check and/or modify their descriptions.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** Good point. We removed the \"more quickly\" part from the abstract.\r\n\r\n> Interpretation of the results\r\n\r\n> The authors should consider offering possible explanations of their results and design recommendations. Could gatherplot be better than jittering because the dots are in a rectangular layout and therefore easier to glance at or count? How should we use gatherplots given those experimental results? Having interpretations like these on top of a list of statistics can make this paper more useful and informative for future research.\r\n\r\n**Revisions:** Thanks for this feedback. We have added a new Discussion section where we have included several of these explanations and generalizations.\r\n\r\n> Misc writing\r\n\r\n> The length of this paper is appropriate for its content, though I did suggest a few places where the authors could elaborate more.\r\n\r\n**Revisions:** Agreed. We have tried to do so based on the reviewer's feedback.\r\n\r\n> Small things\r\n\r\n> Section 1: \"...overlap is known as (or) in visualization\"\r\n\r\n**Revisions:** Thanks. This was actually due to some lingering \\textit{} and \\textbf{} LaTeX commands in the code. This has now been fixed.\r\n\r\n> Two paragraphs start with \"Finally\" in the \"Data-aware Methods\" section.\r\n\r\n**Revisions:** Fixed.\r\n\r\n> Openness/Transparency\r\n\r\n> As a condition for acceptance, I hope the authors can provide the stimuli, data analysis scripts, and any other applicable materials per the Jovi requirements https://www.journalovi.org/author-guide.html#transparency-requirements.\r\n\r\n**Revisions:** Done; we have added all of the available data we have to the OSF repository.\r\n\r\n> The CSV file for the experimental data matches the number of participants, conditions, and repeated trials described in the paper. The README describes the data columns well. I did not find the analysis scripts in the OSF link.\r\n\r\nExcellent.\r\n\r\n> Suggested outcome\r\n> Major revisions: this paper requires substantial improvements that I will need to re-review to decide whether or not to endorse it.\r\n\r\n> Requested changes\r\n> Refine the knowledge contribution in the context of ATOM and potentially newer literature\r\n> Clarify the bin size algorithm and justify the packing layout decision\r\n> Provide experimental stimuli and data analysis scripts\r\n> Resolve analysis issues and elaborate on how analysis results translate to the practical use of gatherplots.\r\n\r\nWe believe this has all been done. Thank you for the careful feedback.\r\n",

Can the authors double-check the completion times reported in the text:\r\n> \r\n> > For the retrieve-value task (T1), on average, the completion time (sec) for each interface was for jitter 31.79, absolute 36.83, normalized 36.55, and both 49.21.\r\n> \r\n> By referencing Figure 13, I find that these values look like the lower bounds of the CI, not the means, though this issue does not affect the conclusions.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** Thanks for spotting this, it was a clear mistake. We have updated the completion time averages in the text.\r\n\r\n> #### Misc typos and issues\r\n> * The Discussion section still states that \"the gatherplots technique enable**[s]** people to assess data distribution more _**quickly**_ and more correctly\", while similar language about \"more quickly\" has been edited out in the revision.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** Fixed, thank you.\r\n\r\n> * Figure 5 `x=Name` issue not fixed\r\n\r\nYes, we are still working on this; I'll address it during this second-round revision process.\r\n\r\n> * \"It is worth comparing gatherplots to _**ur**_ own prior work\" (Section 2)\r\n> * \"We chose to include an interactive setting—``both’’—in our experiment\" (latex style quotation marks, Section 6)\r\n> * `repetitions).}` in Figure 12 caption\r\n\r\n**Revision:** All fixed, thanks!\r\n",

Perhaps it is the colon in the citation key?\r\n\r\n- As it stands, the paper is on track to be published with 3 endorsements and 1 possible endorsement / undendorsement. These decisions will be included in the published paper, along with links to the review threads.\r\n    - Reviewer (issue #7, @joviewer-xyz) will have to decide if they want to endorse, endorse with reservations, or unendorse.\r\n    - If the reviewer does not pick an unqualified \"endorse\", the authors will have to decide if they want to publish at this time, or make additional changes to the paper. \r\n\r\nFinally, I would like to acknowledge that I agree with the outstanding request (i.e., the simulation/user study requested in #7). That said, I also believe the paper in it’s current form makes worthwhile contributions that others can learn and build from.\r\n\r\n### Decision\r\n\r\nEndorse: I am willing to endorse this paper, with at most minor copyediting.\r\n",

It occurred to me that it would be very cool if the [GatherLens section](https://www.journalovi.org/2023-park-gatherplots/#gatherlens-a-gathering-magic-lens) had a working demo of GatherLens embedded in it, rather than a screenshot. Something you could do with this format that would not work in other formats :)",

Regular text must have >4.5:1.\n- [ ] Content has non-visual alternatives. All figures have alt text and videos have transcripts. Equations are screen reader accessible.\n- [ ] Font sizes for all texts are sufficiently large. Text must not be smaller than 9pt/12px in size. Ideally only minor text is rendered at 9pt (e.g., axis labels) while all other text is larger.\n- [ ] The article works even if I could not perceive colors. Color should never be used alone to communicate meaning.\n- [ ] The article can be navigated comfortably with a screen reader. There are no unnecessary accessibility elements (e.g., axis ticks and labels) that clutter the screen reader experience.\n\n### Screen reader\n\n- [X] VoiceOver on macOS\n- [ ] VoiceOver on iOS\n- [ ] NVDA on Windows\n- [ ] JAWS on Windows\n- [ ] Not tested with a screen reader (explain below why not)\n\n### Browser\n\n- [X] Safari or other WebKit-based browser\n- [ ] Chrome or other Chromium-based browser\n- [ ] Firefox\n\n### Comments on Perceivable\n\nAll images should have alt texts that describe the content. \r\n\r\nThe font sizes of the figures is too small, especially on mobile. You can also consider making the figures responsive and change the layout (e.g. horizontal to vertical arrangement of charts) when the screen width changes.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"730\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-04 at 17 17 43\" src=\"https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/assets/589034/01fc86d2-0740-44b6-8575-a16a5906a789\">\r\n\r\nRight now, a lot of the figures rely on being able to differentiate colors. Try using different shapes in addition to color. For example, in figure 4a, you could use different shapes for survived and not survived. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"257\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-04 at 17 20 26\" src=\"https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/assets/589034/c1add383-3ed0-4130-b93b-1d1327557755\">\r\n\r\nI noticed that the tooltips for references open when the VO cursor is over a reference and then the cursor goes into the tooltip. It clutters the VO experience so it feels like it should be different.

For example, increase the font size of titles or make them bold. Some charts already use this style.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"200\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-04 at 17 28 17\" src=\"https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/assets/589034/44f3e035-0c29-4b63-a1da-39f1bc12289a\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"271\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-04 at 17 27 37\" src=\"https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/assets/589034/6820157d-7d33-4aa1-99e9-df8356c1514c\">\n\n### Robust\n\n- [X] All buttons use the `button` tag.\n- [X] Headings, paragraphs, and figures are tagged correctly.\n\n### Comments on Robust\n\nAll good. \n\n### Assistive\n\n- [ ] The data density of all charts is appropriate. Use clustering or other data reduction techniques if elements compete for space but explain the method.\n- [X] Navigation and interaction feels intuitive with all interaction methods (mouse, keyboard, touch).\n- [X] All visually apparent features and relationships are described.\n- [ ] Formatting makes values human-readable. Use , or space to separate thousands. Align numbers to the right. Use the smallest, appropriate number of significant digits.\n\n### Comments on Assistive\n\nThe density of labels is too high in some cases and the marks are very densely packed. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"115\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-04 at 17 29 10\" src=\"https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/assets/589034/d3d6c9ad-120f-4992-88c7-b4b8fc21078a\">\r\n\r\nThe formatting of some numbers could be improved. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"682\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-04 at 17 29 46\" src=\"https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/assets/589034/6f9e7ba1-22f8-4152-bbdc-be3e61c1ef9f\">\r\n\n\n### Flexible\n\n- [ ] The article is readable on a phone.\n- [X] The article can be zoomed and font-sizes change appropriately. The layout of the page does not break when zooming in or changing the font size (e.g., using CMD + or CMD - on macOS).\n- [X] Long animations (if they exist) can be paused or stopped. Animations should be videos, not GIFs as they cannot be paused.\n- [ ] Style and charts use a consistent and familiar design (fonts, colors, etc). Interaction defaults should be consistent for all interactive elements.\n\n### Comments on Flexible\n\nAs mentioned before, the font sizes in figures are too small on phones.\r\n\r\nI found it somewhat difficult to follow some of the charts because they use very different visual styles (fonts, colors, font sizes, etc). This probably happened because the charts use different libraries. It would be good to use one familiar style. This would greatly improve understandability. \n\n### ORCID\n\n0000-0002-3110-1053",

			"body": "Thanks for this @domoritz!\r\n\r\nI have some questions about some of the criteria and how we can make them work well. Adding @frankelavsky too since I think his opinion would be valuable.\r\n\r\nMy first thought is: it would be helpful to have a sense of what is critical or not. Perhaps a distinction between \"minimum requirements\" versus \"nice to have\". Then we could give a paper a rating like \"F (fail) / B (pass) / A / A+\" or something like that in an infobox at the top of the paper. When I look at Chartability, I see some issues listed as \"critical\", maybe that's a starting point for establishing such levels?\r\n\r\nSome other thoughts:\r\n\r\n- This criterion strikes me as too strict: *The article works even if I could not perceive colors. Color should never be used alone to communicate meaning.*\r\n\r\n   This is a difficult criterion to have in a visualization journal, and when I look at Chartability it is not listed as \"critical\" and comes with this qualification: \r\n\r\n   > While this standard is very difficult for the field of data visualization to wrestle with, there is also little research that explores effective strategies.\r\n\r\n   It is a little difficult to say \"solve this problem in your paper, but we don't know how\". I can imagine a number of cases where this criterion will difficult or impossible to be fulfilled (e.g., research on color, complex visualizations of multivariate data where other channels have run out, etc). I agree it is worth striving for, and for the paper at hand is probably easier to achieve than some others, but given the lack of existing good solutions it is a high bar to ask of all authors. Perhaps we can soften the language and/or make it a non-critical criterion (like in Chartability).\r\n\r\n- I wonder about this comment:\r\n\r\n   > The font sizes of the figures is too small, especially on mobile. You can also consider making the figures responsive and change the layout (e.g. horizontal to vertical arrangement of charts) when the screen width changes.\r\n\r\n   Totally agree about desktop fonts being too small in several figures. I'm wondering what general advice we can give for folks on mobile --- responsive visualization will be hard or impossible in many cases (e.g., screenshots of desktop VA systems, or people generating charts from static vis tools). For folks using static vis tools, it would be cool if there was a quarto solution where they could provide alternate plots for the same chunk that could be selected responsively (@cscheid?). However, I am wary of placing strict requirements that people use responsive vis tools, since the vast majority of such tools can't do that. So I also wonder if a softer version of this criteria would be considered satisfied if the vis is readable on desktop and at least zoomable on mobile, even if not responsive?\r\n\r\n- Lastly, because the description text is stripped when the review is generated, the helpful links to the Chartability sections visible on the review form are not available to authors to get more information. Maybe we could add links to the corresponding information in Chartability to each checkbox item?\r\n\r\nThanks again for all of this!",

			"body": "I have just pushed changes addressing this accessibility review: https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/6. Here follows the revision response itself. Please let me know if some other format is expected for this!\r\n\r\n> All images should have alt texts that describe the content.\r\n\r\nI have improved the alt-text for all of the images in the article.\r\n\r\n> The font sizes of the figures is too small, especially on mobile. You can also consider making the figures responsive and change the layout (e.g. horizontal to vertical arrangement of charts) when the screen width changes.\r\n\r\nI have tried to make the images responsive by turning on the `fig-responsive` setting in the format as well as splitting compound images into component pieces so that they can be better displayed on mobile.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have chosen **not** to modify images drawn from the Gatherplot implementations. This means that some of the labels, such as in Figure 1, are kept in their original size. Given that an interactive article is primarily intended to be viewed online, it should be possible to see images at full size.\r\n\r\n> Right now, a lot of the figures rely on being able to differentiate colors. Try using different shapes in addition to color. For example, in figure 4a, you could use different shapes for survived and not survived.\r\n\r\nWhile I appreciate this feedback, this functionality would require modifying the visualization and is thus not part of any of the Gatherplot implementations. I leave such features for future work.\r\n\r\n> The visual hierarchy of axis labels and axis titles could be improved. For example, increase the font size of titles or make them bold. Some charts already use this style.\r\n\r\nAs discussed above, I have chosen to not modify the original images from our Gatherplots implementation.\r\n\r\n> The density of labels is too high in some cases and the marks are very densely packed.\r\n\r\nSee above; we have chosen not to edit the visualization images but rather to make them larger.\r\n\r\n> As mentioned before, the font sizes in figures are too small on phones.\r\n\r\nI have tried to address font sizes to the extent possible.\r\n\r\n> I found it somewhat difficult to follow some of the charts because they use very different visual styles (fonts, colors, font sizes, etc). This probably happened because the charts use different libraries. It would be good to use one familiar style. This would greatly improve understandability.\r\n\r\nThis is a fair point. Unfortunately, we are presenting results from both our old Gatherplots implementation (no longer accessible), Observable Plot, and our own new Gatherplot implementation. They all provide slightly different functionality that I want to demonstrate in the article.\r\n\r\nI hope I have addressed all of the concerns, but I am happy to iterate on any issues that still persist.",

			"body": "Thanks for the updates. These are great and I agree that it doesn't make sense to change the figures for the old implementation. \r\n\r\nI found three issues that need to be fixed. \r\n\r\nFirst, the issue with tooltips @cscheid commented on in https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/10#issuecomment-1675190237 still exists and it making it almost impossible to navigate the document with a screen reader. This needs to be fixed in quarto but until it is, I would suggest disabling tooltips for references. \r\n\r\nSecond, it's great that you broke up the images but the threshold for wrapping should be lower. Can you set a minimum image size? See how the images get super small on a narrow screen.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"847\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 12 34 22\" src=\"https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/assets/589034/151e180e-00a1-4b73-ad01-396f9e166142\">\r\n\r\nLastly, the screen reader experience for the plot charts is too noisy. Try navigating the document and you will find that all tick marks are navigated. Axes should be described in one AX element per axis or skipped and described in the description. Also, each mark in the scatterplot becomes its own accessibility element. It's probably best to group them so that one can skip over the group to reduce noise. See the last comment in the perceivable block at the top: \"The article can be navigated comfortably with a screen reader. There are no unnecessary accessibility elements (e.g., axis ticks and labels) that clutter the screen reader experience.\"\r\n\r\n<img width=\"844\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 12 33 19\" src=\"https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/assets/589034/a62b62c9-a1c9-412b-833e-2125e6f2b72d\">",

			"body": "> Thanks for the updates. These are great and I agree that it doesn't make sense to change the figures for the old implementation.\r\n> I found three issues that need to be fixed.\r\n> \r\n> First, the issue with tooltips @cscheid commented on in #10 (comment) still exists and it making it almost impossible to navigate the document with a screen reader. This needs to be fixed in quarto but until it is, I would suggest disabling tooltips for references.\r\n\r\nI have disabled the tooltips for now. For the record, this is done by adding the following options to the HTML format block:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    citations-hover: false\r\n    footnotes-hover: false\r\n    crossrefs-hover: false\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Second, it's great that you broke up the images but the threshold for wrapping should be lower. Can you set a minimum image size? See how the images get super small on a narrow screen.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no easy way to do this and maintain responsiveness. For now, I have added a min-width in a CSS class (.accessible-fig), but the responsive behavior no longer works. Pointers on how to achieve this are welcome, but at least the new version is easier to read.\r\n\r\nThe results in Figure 12 and 13 are still in three-column format, but if need be I can change this as well.\r\n\r\n> Lastly, the screen reader experience for the plot charts is too noisy. Try navigating the document and you will find that all tick marks are navigated. Axes should be described in one AX element per axis or skipped and described in the description. Also, each mark in the scatterplot becomes its own accessibility element. It's probably best to group them so that one can skip over the group to reduce noise. See the last comment in the perceivable block at the top: \"The article can be navigated comfortably with a screen reader. There are no unnecessary accessibility elements (e.g., axis ticks and labels) that clutter the screen reader experience.\"\r\n\r\nUnderstood. This is an Observable Plot chart, however. I don't know how to change this short of reimplementing the scatterplot myself.\r\n",

As long we keep updating observable plot I think what we have now is good enough.\r\n\r\nHopefully I can make time to look into automatic aria descriptions for marks (similar to what we already have out of the box in Vega-Lite) for Plot at some point as well.\r\n\r\nI think that's what I love about living documents in e.g. jovi. We can make these improvements at the library levels and all documents that use the libraries can be updates to use the improvements. ",

			"body": "We discussed this previously, and came to the conclusion that including `index.html` (despite it being a generated file) is helpful for several reasons:\r\n\r\n- We support non-quarto submissions; having a standard location of the actual paper makes it easier to support a range of document generators (including ones we can't run).\r\n- Having a compiled version gives us a comparison doc we can use to verify correctness of our own compilation.\r\n- Having a compiled version in the repo is better for long-term archiving, since one can (e.g.) use a service like Zenodo to get a long-term archived version of the main branch of the repo, including the rendered paper. Such archives are likely to last longer than our ability to run quarto.\r\n\r\nIt shouldn't make merge conflicts that hard to deal with as conflicts should only arise if you can generate the file, and if you can generate the file you don't need to resolve conflicts on it (since you can just clobber and re-generate).\r\n\r\nHappy to entertain suggestions for a better approach, but on balance I prefer leaving `index.html` in atm.",

			"body": "### Conflicts of interest\n\n- [X] I declare that I have no known conflicts of interest with the authors.\n\n### Review\n\nThis paper seeks to make constructing scatterplots less prone to overlap when using categorical axes. To do so, they introduce a method called gatherplot/gather transform. It involves a mechanism for two-dimensional partitioning and a series of layout algorithms for presenting unit visualizations within those partitions. The algorithms are three: absolute (which is a waffle plot-like layout), normalized (space-filling waffle plot), and stream graph (a specialization of absolute, it seems). This is evaluated via a series of examples (in figures) and a crowd-work study. Various design considerations are described, including combining the gatherplot with a magic lens style interaction (gather lens).\r\n\r\nThis is generally interesting work that seeks to solve a realistic problem; however, I think it is _currently_ a ways from being ready for publication. To wit, despite the clear enunciation of contributions provided in the introduction, I suggest that it is slightly ambiguous what is contributed in this work. It is suggested that there are four contributions:\r\n\r\n1: gather visual transform  \r\n2: gather plot chart type  \r\n3: gather lens\r\n4: the crowd work evaluation\r\n\r\n- I would argue that (1) is not a contribution made in this work, as it is simply the idea of data-based partitions (which is well known, as this is the idea of a data cube). In addition, as discussed below, some issues with that section's presentation impede its clarity.\r\n- While the inclusion of a magic lens is pretty interesting, I do not think it is a contribution in its current form. Why is this interaction particularly well matched with this chart type? The figure demonstrating this feature seems to show a scatterplot with substantial overlap, which would seem to suggest that it is not a gatherplot (but it is unclear). If these are not to be used in conjunction with gatherplots, then it would seem that this is a separate contribution and should be explored in its own context rather than taking the spotlight off gatherplots. Suggesting then that (3) is also yet to be a contribution.\r\n- I think the contribution of a new plot type is certainly interesting (2), and while gatherplot resembles many other chart types (for instance, bee swarm/swarm plots), they are unusual in their modularity. However, the particular evaluation strategy does not demonstrate this is a good chart relative to other chart types. It only shows that one mode (jitter) is less accurate than others, not that it is better than comparable chart types, nor does it enumerate what it can and can not do (see below for more about this). Similarly, an important idea with developing a chart type is that it makes it easy to conceptualize things for their users—things that might be difficult to do otherwise. It would be exciting to compare gatherplots as chart type against atom as a unit grammar.\r\n- It is also possible that the sub-algorithms (norm/abs/streamgraph) might be claimed as contributions. These are interesting algorithms, and the crowd-work study does approach evaluating them. However, there is also a very large space of additional algorithms that might be slotted into the gather transformation. For instance, in #4 @RaphaelWimmer asks about the relationship between this work and the somewhat well-known swarm plots. There are many forms of swarm plot, but [a prominent one](https://vega.github.io/vega/examples/beeswarm-plot/) involves using simple force-direction as means to create non-overlapping layouts. Other charts could be developed as well: for instance, nothing is stopping the partitions from containing things like unit-based pies or spirals and so on. It is not demonstrated that these are the best layout algorithms for this context or even really described what the space of possible charts might be (which would be an interesting contribution, although likely quite similar to atom).\r\n\r\nI think the main way in which InfoVis can build on this work is based on the result found in the user study that the normed/abs layouts are easier to use than just jitter—suggest perhaps a guideline that layouts other than jitter should be used, (which is a useful guideline that can be easily and directly applied elsewhere). However, the main body of the contribution (gatherplots) is somewhat under-evaluated. In addition, many components of the work that contribute to the overall construction need more care.\r\n\r\n_Evaluation_: I have some additional comments/questions about the evaluation.\r\n\r\n- what are the limitations of this approach? What can it do? What can it not do? In the current presentation, this isn't really reflected on (nor are the results of the study synthesized)\r\n- Given that this work seeks to be in dialog with scatterplots, I was surprised not to see usage of Sarikaya and Gleicher's \"Scatterplots: Tasks, Data, and Design\" task typology. Several tasks are described throughout (such as highlighting outliers), but these are not drawn from a single systemic task model. I would like to see a clear description of what tasks gatherplots (ideally in each mode) succeed and fail under such designs. This might more clearly allow the reader to understand the contribution of gatherplots.\r\n- I like that the presentation of the evaluation is fairly systematic. Could some of these points be combined in such a way that we get all of this information from a single chart? Similarly, I found it a little difficult to compare the algorithms in Figure 12, it'd be nice just to make 1 line per task (ideally with some context so we don't have to look up what the tasks are) and then pivot the algorithm by color and a small dy offset\r\n- How much were participants paid?\r\n- Was the stream plot tested? If not, why not?\r\n- I would like to see an example of the stimulus shown to participants in the paper. There's no space limit here! Please be generous with visual evidence.\r\n- I would like to see a direct comparison with/commentary on the author's own work atom. How does this compare to that? Can any of the algorithms in gatherplot be expressed as atom charts? Or does atom already do all of what this does? (Similarly there a large number of related charts mentioned in the related work, itd be useful to see a gallery of each of them trying to produce the same chart, to see how this form relates to those)\r\n- I am not evaluating the statistics applied in the evaluation; I leave that to a reviewer with greater expertise in that style of analysis.\r\n\r\n_Mathematical Rigor_: Section 3 attempts rigorously define the problem setting and proposed chart. I emphasize that I really like that the paper tries to be rigorous in its description, however, the level of rigor is far from sufficient and the resulting formalism is not used in the execution of the chart\r\nMajorly: the specific of the overlap definition is imprecise and allows for a wide variety of overlaps. For instance, it is not clear if mark size s refers to radius or diameter, each of which fails in various basic cases:\r\n\r\n![fig](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/assets/139371969/012b0866-945e-4167-b30c-9bc19ea8c108)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe radius case fails the test but is still clearly visible and should not be counted as overlapping as it can clearly be read, even at full opacity. Diameter case passes but clearly should fail as the center circle is totally overlapped. To make matters slightly more difficult, this definition is only applied _per dimension_. Overlaps in multiple dimensions may be more quarrelsome to catch points hidden by multi-dimensional overlaps (as above). In all, this makes this definition/test very, very brittle.\r\n\r\nMore minorly: many symbols in use are not defined or are hand-waved through. C is not defined, p_x is suggested as being a point, but this is not clearly defined, and D is not rigorously defined (for instance, what is its relationship with the rest of the data set?). The Describe corollary is not a corollary (in particular bc there have not been proofs), but also because it is a direct consequence of the definition used.\r\n\r\nGiven that this section has little consequence for the rest of the work, I recommend that it be removed. However, I would, of course, be happy to be wrong about the rigor of this measurement. This might be demonstrated empirically by measuring synthetic data sets with known amounts of overlap. (Similarly, I would like to see a visual argument of the \"using the gather transformation\" section and the \"segments as labeled intervals instead of labeled major and minor ticks\" in the preceding section. Claims are being made here, there should be evidence provided.)\r\n\r\nRelated\r\n\r\n- How does this definition handle varying-sized marks (can unit visualizations not encode size as one of their attributes? Perhaps \"Relaxed Dot Plots\" might make a point of comparison here?)\r\n- How does this handle not symmetric elements?\r\n\r\n_Misc_\r\n\r\n- I like that there is a certain amount of reasoning about how to effectively design with this chart type, but I wish that I found the arguments made in the visual design and interaction sections were more carefully argued. For instance, it suggested that stroke lines should be avoided all of the time, but this would seem to limit many designs needlessly. Why impose such a strict rule if it isn't necessary? It is noted that several alternate designs are considered for what mark to use, however the specifics of these design explorations are not discussed. Reciprocally, there is discussion of the interval tick marks, however the conclusion that 9f is the optimal design seems shallowly argued based on a notion of minimalism (which is itself debatable compared to 9e).\r\n- The axis folding interaction seems quite interesting, but it isn't evaluated (also, as a viewer, I expected it to fold to an aggregate? is it not creating visual distortion in its current form? )\r\n- I think it's part of the work's conceit that unit visualizations are worth considering, which I am willing to accept as a premise. However, the paper repeatedly dismisses aggregate marks as not being valuable, even though they are still plenty usable and unambiguous (such as in cluster views and so on). My favorite example of this usability is the Craigslist apartment finder, which uses clustering to great effect (although there are of course countless other examples). I would like to see a more careful argument why we should dismiss these forms out of hand.\r\n- A number of chart forms are dismissed in the intro/related work sections as they are unable to handle larger data, which is a flaw of this approach as well (for instance how would gatherplots deal with 1 million data points). Similarly, it is noted but not argued that changing \"mark size, increasing display space, or animating the data\" are not practical changes. It would be good to make these statements more careful.\r\n- It looks like this paper may be a resubmission from an earlier time. To be clear: there is nothing at all wrong with resubmitting something later. However, it also appears that the paper has not been updated in at least five years. While it is true that some things are timeless, part of rigorous work is to be in dialog with contemporary scholarship and relating the value of the work to those that came before it (or after it, as the case may be)—for instance, missing Sarikaya's scatterplot task model and all of the thoughtful empirical work that appears after it (or swarm plots!) seems like an oversight. Per the reviewer guidelines, I don't hold the authors to this point but merely note it.\r\n- There's a handful of typos throughout, some more confusing (\"Plotting the gives rise to diagonal line\"), some less (\"$p<0.01>$\", \"as (or ) in\"), but all should be fixed\r\n- It would be nice if there was a clear way for others to use this system outside of the provided interfaces. Consider extracting the layout algorithms somewhere reusable (like an npm package). I suggest that this type of engineering consideration helps supports the goals of openness held by this journal (what's more open then being able to try something yourself?), and so should be taken seriously. Related: it is noted in the preface that the system is implemented on observable. While I can see that this is true in the code for the article, providing a link to the observable notebook might be clearer, which I would imagine would be a more common way to interpret that assertion.\r\n- While I am intrigued by its inclusion, I don't quite understand why Firebase is a necessary component of this system. What properties of Firebase's real-time database are utilized? Is it just for hosting? If the latter, then it does not need to be listed as part of the implementation strategy.\r\n- Figure 5, in its pre-interaction state, may show an implementation bug (see below). It looks like it is saying that the vw rabbit custom is the whole axis when in fact, it's the name?\r\n\r\n![bugg](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/assets/139371969/beb6edaf-1b76-4a8e-84eb-d4b585bd6557)\r\n\r\n\n\n### Openness/Transparency\n\nRequired\r\n- An example of the stimuli used the crowd work study\r\n- The scripts used to produce the analysis\r\n\r\nNice to have\r\n- a way for others to use this approach (such as an npm library or observable chart type)\n\n### Submission categories\n\n- [ ] Registered Report\n- [ ] Replication Study\n- [ ] Empirical Research - Quantitative\n- [ ] Empirical Research - Qualitative\n- [X] Systems or design research\n- [ ] Commentary\n- [ ] Systematic Literature Review\n\n### Suggested outcome\n\nMajor revisions: this paper requires substantial improvements that I will need to re-review to decide whether or not to endorse it.\r\n\n\n### Requested changes\n\nMajor\r\n\r\n- Remove (or make rigorous) the overlap formalism\r\n- Remove (or more carefully argue) the design recommendations\r\n- Remove the discussion of gather lens, or, provide convincing evidence why this is unique to approach\r\n- Provide clearer comparison with other chart types or (preferably) clearly demonstrate what tasks can and can not be done with this chart type\r\n\r\nMinor\r\n\r\n- typos, presentational issues noted throughout\n\n### ORCID\n\n_No response_",

					"body": "## Review Links\r\nReviewed Version: 0c1a8b893097f65347f0e200c6b8850b91b6b8cb\r\nR1 [#7](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/7)\r\nR2 [#15](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/15)\r\nR3 [#16](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/16)\r\nAccessibility [#6](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/6)\r\n\r\nReviewers were generally positive about the GatherPlots direction and evaluation approach, but also offered several concrete suggestions for revisions.\r\nRevisions that should be emphasized for the next round of review include:\r\n\r\n## Novelty\r\nAll reviews noted issues with the novelty claims of the work ([#16](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/16), [#15](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/15), [#7](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/7)).\r\nThe main reason noted is a more recent work called Atom, which seems to have built on Gatherplots.\r\nWhile other novelty considerations (listed below) are important to address, the relation to Atom seems most pressing.\r\n\r\nOne suggestion from [#7](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/7) as an approach to addressing novelty issues is to revise the submission to talk more about how Gatherplots feeds into Atom explicitly. Atom seems to have an overlapping set of authors, and because JoVI emphasizes rigor over novelty, this approach would be appropriate. For example, are there any core ideas that Gatherplots explored that were generalized in Atom, or approaches that did not make it? Such a retrospective could prove particularly useful for readers while also addressing review issues with novelty claims in the paper as written.\r\n\r\nThere are several other considerations in individual reviews that should be weighed in revising the novelty of the work.\r\nFor example, [#7](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/7) mentions the scatterplot task typology from Sarikaya and Gleicher, while [#16](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/16) sees possible comparisons to Rzeszotarski and Kittur.\r\nI encourage the authors consider suggestions in the individual reviews in the revision, as well.\r\n\r\n## Algorithm Specifics\r\nReviews raise specific concerns about the algorithmic and mathematical details of the work.\r\n[#15](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/15) gives suggestions for clarifying the bin sizing approach.\r\n[#7](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/7) provides several suggestions on the mathematics and geometry of the approach.\r\n[#16](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/16) suggests reducing the mathematical notation to avoid confusion.\r\nAuthors might consider several routes to addressing these concerns, either through strengthening/defending the notations or by tightening/transforming them, e.g. changing to natural language.\r\n\r\n## Evaluation Improvements\r\nReviews also mention possible improvements to the evaluation.\r\nSee [#15](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/15) for several suggestions, including a need for a few additional experiment details and open materials (also a main issue, below).\r\n[#16](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/16) also provides suggestions such as adding additional competitors, or at least discussing how the technique relates to competitors.\r\nTwo approaches may suffice here. Either existing claims and writing could be tightened and made more precise, or new experiments could be added to satisfy claims as they currently are given in the paper. \r\n\r\n## JoVI-required Materials\r\nReviews noted that evaluation materials such as the experiment code, data, and analysis scripts were not available.\r\nAs including such materials are part of JoVI guidelines, these should be included in a revision.\r\nIn particular, these would help with reviewers such as [#15](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/15) who were attempting to replicate the experiment analysis.\r\n\r\n## GatherLens Clarification\r\nThe GatherLens component appears to be an addition to the core of the work.\r\nReviews were generally not positive about its relation to the core GatherPlot narrative.\r\nOne possible way of including it in the submission, however, would be to clearly specify that GatherLens is meant to be a demonstration of how GatherPlots can be composed and used in practice, rather than claiming the GatherLens as a core contribution in itself.\r\n\r\n## Accessibility Review + Changes\r\nThe accessibility review in issue [#6](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/6) highlights several needed and several optional changes for the submission.\r\nIn general, aspects that would impede accessibility on a Desktop should be addressed.\r\nThese include having desktop legible font sizes, especially for figures.\r\nThe submission figures could be improved in this regard.\r\nAll images should also have appropriate alt text.\r\n\r\nOther suggestions, such as label density, are optional as they are not necessarily needed to describe the purpose of the graph.\r\nIn other words, some visualizations may be illustrating the technique, rather than meaning to show the underlying data and axis values.\r\n\r\nFinally, some suggestions may be limitations of the Quarto platform itself. These do not need to be addressed at this time as they may be difficult or impossible to fix.\r\n\r\nDecision: Major Revision\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

			"body": "We thank the reviewer for this feedback. Below I have quoted the relevant parts of the review along with our responses.\r\n\r\n> It is suggested that there are four contributions:\r\n> \r\n> 1: gather visual transform\r\n> 2: gather plot chart type\r\n> 3: gather lens\r\n> 4: the crowd work evaluation\r\n\r\n> I would argue that (1) is not a contribution made in this work, as it is simply the idea of data-based partitions (which is well known, as this is the idea of a data cube). In addition, as discussed below, some issues with that section's presentation impede its clarity.\r\n\r\n**Revision**: We have removed the claim that the gather transformation is a contribution (however, we have chosen to revise rather than remove the section).\r\n\r\n> While the inclusion of a magic lens is pretty interesting, I do not think it is a contribution in its current form. Why is this interaction particularly well matched with this chart type? The figure demonstrating this feature seems to show a scatterplot with substantial overlap, which would seem to suggest that it is not a gatherplot (but it is unclear). If these are not to be used in conjunction with gatherplots, then it would seem that this is a separate contribution and should be explored in its own context rather than taking the spotlight off gatherplots. Suggesting then that (3) is also yet to be a contribution.\r\n\r\nThis is a fair point. We felt that the GatherLens serves as an interesting extension to the gatherplot idea. In fact, we employed a variant of it in our own prior work on interactive topic modeling, where we found it an effective interaction. However, we hear this feedback clearly. Furthermore, the GatherLens implementation is no longer maintained and was not replicated in our clean-room implementation of gatherplots. \r\n\r\n**Revision**: We have removed Section 6 from the paper as well as the third contribution.\r\n\r\n> I think the contribution of a new plot type is certainly interesting (2), and while gatherplot resembles many other chart types (for instance, bee swarm/swarm plots), they are unusual in their modularity. However, the particular evaluation strategy does not demonstrate this is a good chart relative to other chart types. It only shows that one mode (jitter) is less accurate than others, not that it is better than comparable chart types, nor does it enumerate what it can and can not do (see below for more about this). Similarly, an important idea with developing a chart type is that it makes it easy to conceptualize things for their users—things that might be difficult to do otherwise. It would be exciting to compare gatherplots as chart type against atom as a unit grammar.\r\n\r\nWe agree. Our primary goal at the time of the evaluation (Spring 2014) was to compare the approach to jittering, which we felt was a reasonable baseline. Knowing what we know today, we would likely have included a wider set of comparisons.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, with the original students graduated and in their own faculty positions, we are not in a position to extend the study.\r\n\r\n> It is also possible that the sub-algorithms (norm/abs/streamgraph) might be claimed as contributions. These are interesting algorithms, and the crowd-work study does approach evaluating them. However, there is also a very large space of additional algorithms that might be slotted into the gather transformation. For instance, in Difference to Swarmplots? #4 @RaphaelWimmer asks about the relationship between this work and the somewhat well-known swarm plots. There are many forms of swarm plot, but a prominent one involves using simple force-direction as means to create non-overlapping layouts. Other charts could be developed as well: for instance, nothing is stopping the partitions from containing things like unit-based pies or spirals and so on. It is not demonstrated that these are the best layout algorithms for this context or even really described what the space of possible charts might be (which would be an interesting contribution, although likely quite similar to atom).\r\n\r\nAll good points. We had already discussed using glyphs and aggregated visual representations in the partitions in the \"Visual Marks\" section. We have now revised and improved this section to better clarify our focus on unit marks in the paper, but noting that aggregate marks are also possible.\r\n\r\nAs to the comment about swarmplots, this is fair. We have responded to @RaphaelWimmer's issue as well.\r\n\r\n**Revision**: We have added a discussion of stripcharts, beeswarm plots, swarmplots, and stripplots to the subsection \"Visualizing Categorical Variables\". \r\n\r\n> I think the main way in which InfoVis can build on this work is based on the result found in the user study that the normed/abs layouts are easier to use than just jitter—suggest perhaps a guideline that layouts other than jitter should be used, (which is a useful guideline that can be easily and directly applied elsewhere). However, the main body of the contribution (gatherplots) is somewhat under-evaluated. In addition, many components of the work that contribute to the overall construction need more care.\r\n\r\nThank you. We have tried to make improvements throughout the paper based on this review.\r\n\r\n> Evaluation: I have some additional comments/questions about the evaluation.\r\n\r\n> what are the limitations of this approach? What can it do? What can it not do? In the current presentation, this isn't really reflected on (nor are the results of the study synthesized)\r\n\r\n**Revision**: This is a good point. We have added a new Discussion section to the paper where we, among other things, discuss the limitations of the technique.\r\n\r\n> Given that this work seeks to be in dialog with scatterplots, I was surprised not to see usage of Sarikaya and Gleicher's \"Scatterplots: Tasks, Data, and Design\" task typology. Several tasks are described throughout (such as highlighting outliers), but these are not drawn from a single systemic task model. I would like to see a clear description of what tasks gatherplots (ideally in each mode) succeed and fail under such designs. This might more clearly allow the reader to understand the contribution of gatherplots.\r\n\r\nThis is a good point.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** We have added and discussed Sarikaya and Gleicher's paper, and used it to motivate our evaluation.\r\n\r\n> I like that the presentation of the evaluation is fairly systematic. Could some of these points be combined in such a way that we get all of this information from a single chart? Similarly, I found it a little difficult to compare the algorithms in Figure 12, it'd be nice just to make 1 line per task (ideally with some context so we don't have to look up what the tasks are) and then pivot the algorithm by color and a small dy offset\r\n\r\n**Revision:** We have added color to the charts and rearranged them based on task. This makes it easier to compare across visualizations.\r\n\r\n> How much were participants paid?\r\n\r\nParticipants were compensated for their effort consistent with U.S. federal minimum wage ($7.25/hour).\r\n\r\n> Was the stream plot tested? If not, why not?\r\n\r\nIt was not tested. The stream plot is a more specialized form of the gatherplot, and we did not feel it was comparable to other layout modes for this reason.\r\n\r\n> I would like to see an example of the stimulus shown to participants in the paper. There's no space limit here! Please be generous with visual evidence.\r\n\r\n**Revisions:** We have added an example run of the evaluation to the OSF, and we have also added a single example of the visual stimulus as Figure 11 in the paper.\r\n\r\n> I would like to see a direct comparison with/commentary on the author's own work atom. How does this compare to that? Can any of the algorithms in gatherplot be expressed as atom charts? Or does atom already do all of what this does? (Similarly there a large number of related charts mentioned in the related work, itd be useful to see a gallery of each of them trying to produce the same chart, to see how this form relates to those)\r\n\r\n**Revision:** We have added a direct comparison to the end of the subsection titled \"Data-aware Methods\".\r\n\r\n> I am not evaluating the statistics applied in the evaluation; I leave that to a reviewer with greater expertise in that style of analysis.\r\n\r\nThis is fair. We have uploaded our analysis script on OSF for this review.\r\n\r\n> Mathematical Rigor: Section 3 attempts rigorously define the problem setting and proposed chart. I emphasize that I really like that the paper tries to be rigorous in its description, however, the level of rigor is far from sufficient and the resulting formalism is not used in the execution of the chart\r\nMajorly: the specific of the overlap definition is imprecise and allows for a wide variety of overlaps. For instance, it is not clear if mark size s refers to radius or diameter, each of which fails in various basic cases:\r\n\r\nYes, this is absolutely a fair point of criticism. The formalism is not even necessary.\r\n\r\n> The radius case fails the test but is still clearly visible and should not be counted as overlapping as it can clearly be read, even at full opacity. Diameter case passes but clearly should fail as the center circle is totally overlapped. To make matters slightly more difficult, this definition is only applied per dimension. Overlaps in multiple dimensions may be more quarrelsome to catch points hidden by multi-dimensional overlaps (as above). In all, this makes this definition/test very, very brittle.\r\n\r\nAgreed.\r\n\r\n> More minorly: many symbols in use are not defined or are hand-waved through. C is not defined, p_x is suggested as being a point, but this is not clearly defined, and D is not rigorously defined (for instance, what is its relationship with the rest of the data set?). The Describe corollary is not a corollary (in particular bc there have not been proofs), but also because it is a direct consequence of the definition used.\r\n\r\nAgain, we agree.\r\n\r\n> Given that this section has little consequence for the rest of the work, I recommend that it be removed. However, I would, of course, be happy to be wrong about the rigor of this measurement. This might be demonstrated empirically by measuring synthetic data sets with known amounts of overlap. (Similarly, I would like to see a visual argument of the \"using the gather transformation\" section and the \"segments as labeled intervals instead of labeled major and minor ticks\" in the preceding section. Claims are being made here, there should be evidence provided.)\r\n\r\n**Revision:** We have followed the advice and removed the unnecessary formalism from the paper. The subsection on \"Problem Definition\" (defining overlapping) is now entirely removed. We have revised the subsection \"Definition: Gather Transformation\" to eliminate the formalism.\r\n\r\n> How does this definition handle varying-sized marks (can unit visualizations not encode size as one of their attributes? Perhaps \"Relaxed Dot Plots\" might make a point of comparison here?)\r\n\r\nVarying-size marks are outside the scope of the gatherplots technique for now.\r\n\r\n>How does this handle not symmetric elements?\r\n\r\nAgain, agreed. Our more \"common sense\" definition describes this better.\r\n\r\n> I like that there is a certain amount of reasoning about how to effectively design with this chart type, but I wish that I found the arguments made in the visual design and interaction sections were more carefully argued. For instance, it suggested that stroke lines should be avoided all of the time, but this would seem to limit many designs needlessly. Why impose such a strict rule if it isn't necessary? It is noted that several alternate designs are considered for what mark to use, however the specifics of these design explorations are not discussed. Reciprocally, there is discussion of the interval tick marks, however the conclusion that 9f is the optimal design seems shallowly argued based on a notion of minimalism (which is itself debatable compared to 9e).\r\n\r\nThese are fair points.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** We have attempted to reduce these strict \"rules\" throughout the Gatherplots section.\r\n\r\n> The axis folding interaction seems quite interesting, but it isn't evaluated (also, as a viewer, I expected it to fold to an aggregate? is it not creating visual distortion in its current form? )\r\n\r\nYes, we did not evaluate axis folding. Folding to an aggregate would be one design alternative that we did not investigate. However, we do use a standard tick mark to communicate that the axis has been folded (Figure 10).\r\n\r\n> I think it's part of the work's conceit that unit visualizations are worth considering, which I am willing to accept as a premise. However, the paper repeatedly dismisses aggregate marks as not being valuable, even though they are still plenty usable and unambiguous (such as in cluster views and so on). My favorite example of this usability is the Craigslist apartment finder, which uses clustering to great effect (although there are of course countless other examples). I would like to see a more careful argument why we should dismiss these forms out of hand.\r\n\r\nThis is a fair point. We were over-eager in evangelizing the merits of gatherplots in the paper.\r\n\r\n**Revisions**: We have softened these statements throughout the paper.\r\n\r\n> A number of chart forms are dismissed in the intro/related work sections as they are unable to handle larger data, which is a flaw of this approach as well (for instance how would gatherplots deal with 1 million data points). Similarly, it is noted but not argued that changing \"mark size, increasing display space, or animating the data\" are not practical changes. It would be good to make these statements more careful.\r\n\r\nAnother fair point; ibid above.\r\n\r\n> It looks like this paper may be a resubmission from an earlier time. To be clear: there is nothing at all wrong with resubmitting something later. However, it also appears that the paper has not been updated in at least five years. While it is true that some things are timeless, part of rigorous work is to be in dialog with contemporary scholarship and relating the value of the work to those that came before it (or after it, as the case may be)—for instance, missing Sarikaya's scatterplot task model and all of the thoughtful empirical work that appears after it (or swarm plots!) seems like an oversight. Per the reviewer guidelines, I don't hold the authors to this point but merely note it.\r\n\r\nYes, this is well-spotted. The paper seemed a good fit for the JoVI experimental interactive article track, so here we are.\r\n\r\n> There's a handful of typos throughout, some more confusing (\"Plotting the gives rise to diagonal line\"), some less (\"$p<0.01>$\", \"as (or ) in\"), but all should be fixed\r\n\r\n**Revision:** Thanks. We have attempted to fix these problems.\r\n\r\n> It would be nice if there was a clear way for others to use this system outside of the provided interfaces. Consider extracting the layout algorithms somewhere reusable (like an npm package). I suggest that this type of engineering consideration helps supports the goals of openness held by this journal (what's more open then being able to try something yourself?), and so should be taken seriously. Related: it is noted in the preface that the system is implemented on observable. While I can see that this is true in the code for the article, providing a link to the observable notebook might be clearer, which I would imagine would be a more common way to interpret that assertion.\r\n\r\nWe have followed the JoVI interactive article method of embedding the code in the article itself. The Quarto format internally uses Observable notebooks for its interactive features. In other words, the article *is* the Observable implementation.\r\n\r\n> While I am intrigued by its inclusion, I don't quite understand why Firebase is a necessary component of this system. What properties of Firebase's real-time database are utilized? Is it just for hosting? If the latter, then it does not need to be listed as part of the implementation strategy.\r\n\r\nThis was merely for hosting purposes.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** We have removed Firebase as part of the implementation strategy.\r\n\r\n> Figure 5, in its pre-interaction state, may show an implementation bug (see below). It looks like it is saying that the vw rabbit custom is the whole axis when in fact, it's the name?\r\n\r\nYes, this is a bug. We are addressing it.\r\n\r\n> Suggested outcome\r\n> Major revisions: this paper requires substantial improvements that I will need to re-review to decide whether or not to endorse it.\r\n\r\nWe have revised the paper based on this review and hope that the new version will meet with the reviewer's approval. Thanks again for the careful attention to detail!\r\n",

			"body": "I thank the authors for their hard work in updating the paper. It is substantially improved from the previous version. I appreciate the streamlined focus of the paper, which now more clearly enunciates its contribution as being centered on the gather plot chart type and corresponding user study. Further it much more clearly positions itself within work that has occurred after its initial submission.\r\n\r\nI read the paper as now offering a solution to the problems of over-plotting in scatterplot and the data distortion caused by a common approach to resolving that issue while maintaining unit visualizations. Within that tighter scope the evaluation does demonstrate that this strategy succeeds in that goal, for a particular range and set of parameters. I suggest that the last piece needed to finish this work (beside some additional textual clean up) would be to characterize the parameter ranges in which this should be used. How many points, how many categorical variables can be used, and so on. To this end: an argument made early on is that over-plotting does not scale for larger datasets, however it seems likely that gather plot also does not scale to larger datasets. I appreciated the added note in the discussion to this effect, but this work would be made much stronger if ballpark estimates on when it would be appropriate to use a different chart type. Ideally such questions could be answered through another crowd work study. However, @nickelm has emphasized in responding to all three reviews that additions to the study are not possible because the student has departed, suggesting that such requests are unlikely to be met (although, I will admit, this is a frustrating response given the apparent simplicity of the study conducted). In light of this I suggest that a simulation study, such as exploring the differentiability of points in pixel space (or applying the definitions of legibility/accuracy in a computational manner) might also address these concerns and could be done with only the implementation actively being used on the web page.  \r\n\r\nI have a few other notes that should be addressed in revision, but I think this work is generally on a good course.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Major\r\n\r\n\r\n- It is repeatedly emphasized (through the intro/related works) that aggregated plots are not sufficient because they forgo the unit visibility. While this is essentially an axiom for unit visualizations, I am not sure that it is convincingly argued: why is it important that these values be shown? If there are so many points that aggregation is possibly necessary/appropriate then is the value of unit-izing?  For instance, I suggest that in the user study something like a pivot table would probably do just as good (if not better) than all of the stimuli examined. I implied this in my first review and make explicit it here, because an important part of characterizing the space of useful applications requested should also highlight when actually using gather plots will be useful.\r\n\r\n- I found the \"using the gather transformation\" subsection to be incomprehensible. The first paragraph feels like there may have been some splicing with previous arguments that have left it to be pretty unclear. The second paragraph seems to be arguing that the axes are a visualization, which I find to be generally unconvincing in its current form. The figure just below it does not seem to support this idea either. Comparison with parallel sets is an interesting idea, but if this is an important contribution (and from my reading of the other reviews/responses it is not) then this section should be re-written and this argument made more explicit. Alternative (and preferably) this section should be removed.\r\n\r\n- There are still some lines of reasoning about the design guidelines (cf \"we recommend using a rectangle with constant rounded edge.\", \"on the order of 10 or less\") that are not clearly argued. I continue to recommend that these be removed or substantially more care put into making those arguments. For instance, to the former of these referenced arguments, this could be done with a figure. However, given my basic request of \"better characterizing the design and parameter space\", it would be good to not remove this argument, but expand it: there are many other mark types that are possible (eg text, emoji, etc) it would be good to characterize the design space more clearly. Related: Perhaps instead it would be good to emphasize (at least in the \"Visual Design\" section) that these choices are not specifically necessary to the contribution but are merely the ones explored in this implementation. Can more commentary/reflection be offered in this section to guide future usage?\r\n\r\n\r\n## Minor\r\n\r\n- The definition of legibility / accuracy seems to be VERY tightly bound to a notion of unit visualizations. it would be good to justify these slightly unusual uses of these terms.\r\n\r\n- I would think that a more conventional response to seeing a highly over-plotted scatterplot like the one in Figure 7 would be to facet it by color so that there was less visual conflict? This would be a good case to add. Per my earlier request for a more formal accounting of the limits of this chart form, it would be useful to make the number of points in the chart resizable (e.g. a slider for N) so that the reader might be able to see for themselves how well this does at different granularities.   \r\n\r\n- my comment about alternate layouts within cells is not addressed in the update, I still am curious about the potential of other spatial arrangements (such as pie charts and so on). In the response it is suggested that the Visual Marks subsection addresses this concern, but I emphasize that my question was about the arrangement of the units within an aggregation cell and not the content of the marks.\r\n\r\n- It would be interesting to explore the design space of marginalia for this chart type. For instance, in scatterplots strip plots or kdes are sometimes used to show a 1d depiction of a distribution along one axis. Related: How do grid lines fit into the design space of this chart type?\r\n\r\n- \"same continuous variable on both axes\" gives rise to an interesting 1D visualization. It might be worth comparing with Correll's studies on that genre (\"Teru Teru Bōzu: Defensive Raincloud Plots\" and \"Looks good to me: Visualizations as sanity checks\")\r\n\r\n- Presentation notes: It might be clearer to merge the gather transform and gather plot sections as they are pretty deeply intertwined. Contrastingly, I found the presentation of the gather transform to be pretty fast, maybe my reading is biased by the previous version, but I was expecting a slower and more explicit description of the transform (perhaps via a diagram)? Some places to be more precise:\r\n\r\n> \"simplest among them are histograms\"\r\n\r\nIs this the correct name for this chart type? I would have thought that bar chart is meant here, as histograms typically convey binning of a quantitative variable, but perhaps there is some history I am not aware of.\r\n\r\n> Wilkinson proposed .25n^-1/2 as the optimal dot size for dot plots\r\n\r\nWhat is n in this case\r\n\r\n> It also introduces uncertainty that is not aptly communicated by the scatter plot since marks will no longer be placed at their true location on the Cartesian space.\r\n\r\nI believe that this is not a conventional usage of the term uncertainty. I believe distortion is intended.\r\n\r\n> Some trivial but impractical\r\n\r\nStill don't buy that these are trivial or impractical. The following argument does not justify this harsh position.\r\n\r\n\r\n- There are still a number of typos throughout. For instance, some inaccuracies with made cuts, for instance gather lens/parallel sets is mentioned in the intro and conclusion, there are still some stray $s, \"to ur own\"\r\n",

			"body": "> I thank the authors for their hard work in updating the paper. It is substantially improved from the previous version. I appreciate the streamlined focus of the paper, which now more clearly enunciates its contribution as being centered on the gather plot chart type and corresponding user study. Further it much more clearly positions itself within work that has occurred after its initial submission.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n> I read the paper as now offering a solution to the problems of over-plotting in scatterplot and the data distortion caused by a common approach to resolving that issue while maintaining unit visualizations. Within that tighter scope the evaluation does demonstrate that this strategy succeeds in that goal, for a particular range and set of parameters. I suggest that the last piece needed to finish this work (beside some additional textual clean up) would be to characterize the parameter ranges in which this should be used. How many points, how many categorical variables can be used, and so on. To this end: an argument made early on is that over-plotting does not scale for larger datasets, however it seems likely that gather plot also does not scale to larger datasets. I appreciated the added note in the discussion to this effect, but this work would be made much stronger if ballpark estimates on when it would be appropriate to use a different chart type. Ideally such questions could be answered through another crowd work study. However, @nickelm has emphasized in responding to all three reviews that additions to the study are not possible because the student has departed, suggesting that such requests are unlikely to be met (although, I will admit, this is a frustrating response given the apparent simplicity of the study conducted). In light of this I suggest that a simulation study, such as exploring the differentiability of points in pixel space (or applying the definitions of legibility/accuracy in a computational manner) might also address these concerns and could be done with only the implementation actively being used on the web page.\r\n\r\nI thank the reviewer for their understanding. While nominally a new study could be doable, I recently moved institution (and country), and find myself in a new environment with three-year Ph.D.s where asking a new student to take on an old project such as this seems unfair. \r\n\r\n**Revision:** The idea of quantifying the scalability of gatherplots is sound. I have added a new subsection to Section 4 called \"Visual and Data Scalability\" where I discuss an upper bound for the number of visual marks that can be shown in a gatherplot, especially in \"pathological\" situations where not all the available display space is used by a visual mark. I think that this is a nice addition to the paper, and hope that this treatment will satisfy the reviewer.\r\n\r\n> I have a few other notes that should be addressed in revision, but I think this work is generally on a good course.\r\n> \r\n> ## Major\r\n> * It is repeatedly emphasized (through the intro/related works) that aggregated plots are not sufficient because they forgo the unit visibility. While this is essentially an axiom for unit visualizations, I am not sure that it is convincingly argued: why is it important that these values be shown? If there are so many points that aggregation is possibly necessary/appropriate then is the value of unit-izing?  For instance, I suggest that in the user study something like a pivot table would probably do just as good (if not better) than all of the stimuli examined. I implied this in my first review and make explicit it here, because an important part of characterizing the space of useful applications requested should also highlight when actually using gather plots will be useful.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** Thanks for this feedback. I have added a new subsection called \"Visibility, Discriminability, and Spatial Accuracy\" that discusses this explicitly. This section also brings in the two metrics \"spatial accuracy\" and \"discriminability\" (changed from \"legibility\"; see below) to a more logical place in the article (they were previously introduced in passing in the \"Managing Continuous Variables\" subsection). \r\n\r\n> * I found the \"using the gather transformation\" subsection to be incomprehensible. The first paragraph feels like there may have been some splicing with previous arguments that have left it to be pretty unclear. The second paragraph seems to be arguing that the axes are a visualization, which I find to be generally unconvincing in its current form. The figure just below it does not seem to support this idea either. Comparison with parallel sets is an interesting idea, but if this is an important contribution (and from my reading of the other reviews/responses it is not) then this section should be re-written and this argument made more explicit. Alternative (and preferably) this section should be removed.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** Thank you for highlighting this. I agree and have removed the section. I am not sure where this wording came from originally, but it was certainly orphaned in the current version of the paper.\r\n\r\n> * There are still some lines of reasoning about the design guidelines (cf \"we recommend using a rectangle with constant rounded edge.\", \"on the order of 10 or less\") that are not clearly argued. I continue to recommend that these be removed or substantially more care put into making those arguments. For instance, to the former of these referenced arguments, this could be done with a figure. However, given my basic request of \"better characterizing the design and parameter space\", it would be good to not remove this argument, but expand it: there are many other mark types that are possible (eg text, emoji, etc) it would be good to characterize the design space more clearly. Related: Perhaps instead it would be good to emphasize (at least in the \"Visual Design\" section) that these choices are not specifically necessary to the contribution but are merely the ones explored in this implementation. Can more commentary/reflection be offered in this section to guide future usage?\r\n\r\n**Revision:** We have removed these motivations; for one thing, they were not consistent now that we have two implementations with slightly different designs.\r\n \r\n> ## Minor\r\n> * The definition of legibility / accuracy seems to be VERY tightly bound to a notion of unit visualizations. it would be good to justify these slightly unusual uses of these terms.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** Good point. After some reading, I decided to replace \"legibility\" with \"discriminability\" and add appropriate references to prior art using this term. I have also expanded the discussion in the subsection \"Managing Continuous Variables\" somewhat.\r\n\r\n> * I would think that a more conventional response to seeing a highly over-plotted scatterplot like the one in Figure 7 would be to facet it by color so that there was less visual conflict? This would be a good case to add. Per my earlier request for a more formal accounting of the limits of this chart form, it would be useful to make the number of points in the chart resizable (e.g. a slider for N) so that the reader might be able to see for themselves how well this does at different granularities.\r\n\r\nThis is a good idea, but Figure 7 is not one of the interactive charts so I have not added this feature.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** I have added a note that there are alternatives based on faceting by interaction or by animation to the end of the paragraph discussing Figure 7.\r\n\r\n> * my comment about alternate layouts within cells is not addressed in the update, I still am curious about the potential of other spatial arrangements (such as pie charts and so on). In the response it is suggested that the Visual Marks subsection addresses this concern, but I emphasize that my question was about the arrangement of the units within an aggregation cell and not the content of the marks.\r\n\r\nThanks for clarifying. \r\n\r\n**Revision:** I have added a subsubsection on \"Stacked Group Layout\" to the VIsual Design subsection that discusses different spatial arrangements inside the cells. I also created a figure to illustrate. I hope this is closer to what the reviewer had in mind.\r\n\r\n> * It would be interesting to explore the design space of marginalia for this chart type. For instance, in scatterplots strip plots or kdes are sometimes used to show a 1d depiction of a distribution along one axis. Related: How do grid lines fit into the design space of this chart type?\r\n\r\n**Revision:** We hope that the above new subsubsection will serve. Furthermore, I added a new subsubsection that briefly discusses the role of grid lines in a gatherplot. \r\n\r\n> * \"same continuous variable on both axes\" gives rise to an interesting 1D visualization. It might be worth comparing with Correll's studies on that genre (\"Teru Teru Bōzu: Defensive Raincloud Plots\" and \"Looks good to me: Visualizations as sanity checks\")\r\n\r\n**Revision:** Thanks for the observation. We have discussed this case in particular in the subsection called \"Managing Continuous Variables\" and added citations to the two above papers.\r\n\r\n> * Presentation notes: It might be clearer to merge the gather transform and gather plot sections as they are pretty deeply intertwined. Contrastingly, I found the presentation of the gather transform to be pretty fast, maybe my reading is biased by the previous version, but I was expecting a slower and more explicit description of the transform (perhaps via a diagram)? Some places to be more precise:\r\n\r\nI think there is value to keeping the transform and the plot separate, so I did not end up following this feedback. However, I hope that the new revised Gatherplot Transformation section (see above for my revisions to this section) will better serve.\r\n\r\n> > \"simplest among them are histograms\"\r\n> \r\n> Is this the correct name for this chart type? I would have thought that bar chart is meant here, as histograms typically convey binning of a quantitative variable, but perhaps there is some history I am not aware of.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** Good point; I have revised this to \"bar chart histogram.\"\r\n\r\n> > Wilkinson proposed .25n^-1/2 as the optimal dot size for dot plots\r\n> \r\n> What is n in this case\r\n\r\n\"n\" is the number of data points. \r\n\r\n**Revision:** I have updated the text to include this information as well as add a citation to Wilkinson (1999).\r\n\r\n> > It also introduces uncertainty that is not aptly communicated by the scatter plot since marks will no longer be placed at their true location on the Cartesian space.\r\n> \r\n> I believe that this is not a conventional usage of the term uncertainty. I believe distortion is intended.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** Fixed, thank you!\r\n\r\n> > Some trivial but impractical\r\n> \r\n> Still don't buy that these are trivial or impractical. The following argument does not justify this harsh position.\r\n\r\n**Revision:** Good point. We have revised this unnecessarily harsh statement. \r\n\r\n> * There are still a number of typos throughout. For instance, some inaccuracies with made cuts, for instance gather lens/parallel sets is mentioned in the intro and conclusion, there are still some stray $s, \"to ur own\"\r\n\r\n**Revision:** Thank you; I have tried to fix these throughout the paper.\r\n",

Perhaps it is the colon in the citation key?\r\n\r\n- As it stands, the paper is on track to be published with 3 endorsements and 1 possible endorsement / undendorsement. These decisions will be included in the published paper, along with links to the review threads.\r\n    - Reviewer (issue #7, @joviewer-xyz) will have to decide if they want to endorse, endorse with reservations, or unendorse.\r\n    - If the reviewer does not pick an unqualified \"endorse\", the authors will have to decide if they want to publish at this time, or make additional changes to the paper. \r\n\r\nFinally, I would like to acknowledge that I agree with the outstanding request (i.e., the simulation/user study requested in #7). That said, I also believe the paper in it’s current form makes worthwhile contributions that others can learn and build from.\r\n\r\n### Decision\r\n\r\nEndorse: I am willing to endorse this paper, with at most minor copyediting.\r\n",

Atom seems to have an overlapping set of authors, and because JoVI emphasizes rigor over novelty, this approach would be appropriate. For example, are there any core ideas that Gatherplots explored that were generalized in Atom, or approaches that did not make it? Such a retrospective could prove particularly useful for readers while also addressing review issues with novelty claims in the paper as written.\r\n\r\nThere are several other considerations in individual reviews that should be weighed in revising the novelty of the work.\r\nFor example, [#7](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/7) mentions the scatterplot task typology from Sarikaya and Gleicher, while [#16](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/16) sees possible comparisons to Rzeszotarski and Kittur.\r\nI encourage the authors consider suggestions in the individual reviews in the revision, as well.\r\n\r\n## Algorithm Specifics\r\nReviews raise specific concerns about the algorithmic and mathematical details of the work.\r\n[#15](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/15) gives suggestions for clarifying the bin sizing approach.\r\n[#7](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/7) provides several suggestions on the mathematics and geometry of the approach.\r\n[#16](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/16) suggests reducing the mathematical notation to avoid confusion.\r\nAuthors might consider several routes to addressing these concerns, either through strengthening/defending the notations or by tightening/transforming them, e.g. changing to natural language.\r\n\r\n## Evaluation Improvements\r\nReviews also mention possible improvements to the evaluation.\r\nSee [#15](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/15) for several suggestions, including a need for a few additional experiment details and open materials (also a main issue, below).\r\n[#16](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/16) also provides suggestions such as adding additional competitors, or at least discussing how the technique relates to competitors.\r\nTwo approaches may suffice here. Either existing claims and writing could be tightened and made more precise, or new experiments could be added to satisfy claims as they currently are given in the paper. \r\n\r\n## JoVI-required Materials\r\nReviews noted that evaluation materials such as the experiment code, data, and analysis scripts were not available.\r\nAs including such materials are part of JoVI guidelines, these should be included in a revision.\r\nIn particular, these would help with reviewers such as [#15](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/15) who were attempting to replicate the experiment analysis.\r\n\r\n## GatherLens Clarification\r\nThe GatherLens component appears to be an addition to the core of the work.\r\nReviews were generally not positive about its relation to the core GatherPlot narrative.\r\nOne possible way of including it in the submission, however, would be to clearly specify that GatherLens is meant to be a demonstration of how GatherPlots can be composed and used in practice, rather than claiming the GatherLens as a core contribution in itself.\r\n\r\n## Accessibility Review + Changes\r\nThe accessibility review in issue [#6](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/6) highlights several needed and several optional changes for the submission.\r\nIn general, aspects that would impede accessibility on a Desktop should be addressed.\r\nThese include having desktop legible font sizes, especially for figures.\r\nThe submission figures could be improved in this regard.\r\nAll images should also have appropriate alt text.\r\n\r\nOther suggestions, such as label density, are optional as they are not necessarily needed to describe the purpose of the graph.\r\nIn other words, some visualizations may be illustrating the technique, rather than meaning to show the underlying data and axis values.\r\n\r\nFinally, some suggestions may be limitations of the Quarto platform itself. These do not need to be addressed at this time as they may be difficult or impossible to fix.\r\n\r\nDecision: Major Revision\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Animations should be videos, not GIFs as they cannot be paused.\n- [ ] Style and charts use a consistent and familiar design (fonts, colors, etc). Interaction defaults should be consistent for all interactive elements.\n\n### Comments on Flexible\n\nAs mentioned before, the font sizes in figures are too small on phones.\r\n\r\nI found it somewhat difficult to follow some of the charts because they use very different visual styles (fonts, colors, font sizes, etc). This probably happened because the charts use different libraries. It would be good to use one familiar style. This would greatly improve understandability. \n\n### ORCID\n\n0000-0002-3110-1053",

Perhaps it is the colon in the citation key?\r\n\r\n- As it stands, the paper is on track to be published with 3 endorsements and 1 possible endorsement / undendorsement. These decisions will be included in the published paper, along with links to the review threads.\r\n    - Reviewer (issue #7, @joviewer-xyz) will have to decide if they want to endorse, endorse with reservations, or unendorse.\r\n    - If the reviewer does not pick an unqualified \"endorse\", the authors will have to decide if they want to publish at this time, or make additional changes to the paper. \r\n\r\nFinally, I would like to acknowledge that I agree with the outstanding request (i.e., the simulation/user study requested in #7). That said, I also believe the paper in it’s current form makes worthwhile contributions that others can learn and build from.\r\n\r\n### Decision\r\n\r\nEndorse: I am willing to endorse this paper, with at most minor copyediting.\r\n",

			"body": "Thanks @nickelm!\r\n\r\nOne question I had about the bootstrapping was were participants used to stratify the bootstrap? I tried looking at the data and using the bootstrap.html script to figure this out / recreate the charts, but I was having trouble getting it to work. So, I ended up just quickly recreating the analysis using linear mixed models (since that's more what I'm familiar with) to corroborate the results figures / overall pattern of results. FWIW, it comes out very similarly; see [here](https://mjskay.github.io/gatherplots-data/plot.html) (source [here](https://github.com/mjskay/gatherplots-data/blob/main/plot.qmd)).",

			"body": "Hi @nickelm --- thanks again for all the work getting the materials ready for this. We (the OC) had a conversation about this. \r\n\r\nOur guarantee as a journal is that data *and code* for an analysis is provided, but we don't currently make guarantees that the code works long term (i.e., we don't have a setup for checking the reproducibility of all submitted code). So, from that perspective, we think the code you provided for the bootstrapping analysis is sufficient.\r\n\r\nHowever, we do think there should be some code for the Kruskal-Wallis analysis in order to satisfy the journal requirements. I've used the Kruskal-Wallis test before so I'd be happy to give pointers or help with that if needed.\r\n\r\nEverything else you've listed looks good 👍.\r\n\r\nRe: your list of _Material that is available but currently not added to the OSF_: if it's easy to add to the repo, we don't see any reason not to add it (maybe it helps some future person running a similar experiment...), **except** perhaps the IRB application. @lonnibesancon raised the point in our meeting that there may be some issues with sharing IRB application contents that you would need to check on before doing so; I'll let him comment further since I am not an expert in that area.\r\n",

I will attend to this as soon as this pesky deadline is over. 😉 I look forward to @lonnibesancon's word on the IRB application.\r\n\r\nHi @nickelm!\r\nRegarding IRB approval documents there are two things I would consider. \r\n\r\n1. IRBs do not seem to always agree/approve that such documents are made available publicly. My understanding is that the rules will change in different countries and institutions so please check that you are allowed to share. I am in favor of sharing because...\r\n2. ... there are benefits for meta-analysis and post-publication purposes. I am sure you are aware of our investigation into ethics approval from [last year](https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-023-00134-4). This analysis was difficult and the conclusions we could reach limited because the original ethics approval documents were not publicly available. So there is definitely value in sharing such documents, but keeping point 1 in mind before you do. \r\n\r\nThanks for all of your efforts in making everything transparent and good luck with the upcoming deadline(s).

			"body": "> Hi @nickelm! Regarding IRB approval documents there are two things I would consider.\r\n> \r\n> 1. IRBs do not seem to always agree/approve that such documents are made available publicly. My understanding is that the rules will change in different countries and institutions so please check that you are allowed to share. I am in favor of sharing because...\r\n> 2. ... there are benefits for meta-analysis and post-publication purposes. I am sure you are aware of our investigation into ethics approval from [last year](https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-023-00134-4). This analysis was difficult and the conclusions we could reach limited because the original ethics approval documents were not publicly available. So there is definitely value in sharing such documents, but keeping point 1 in mind before you do.\r\n> \r\n> Thanks for all of your efforts in making everything transparent and good luck with the upcoming deadline(s).\r\n\r\nThanks for your guidance. In response, I've made the IRB documents available ([OSF](https://osf.io/bk9cx/))---I can't see this being a problem since these were all documents that we authored ourselves. Unfortunately, I don't have the approval documents from the IRB because I no longer have access to their internal IRB system (or my old email archives). \r\n\r\n@mjskay: I am still working on the Kruskal-Wallis analysis and will update here once this requirement has been satisfied and the code uploaded to OSF.",

In fact, if you wanted to write a full review instead of just a comment, you are welcome to do that [here](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Review&projects=&template=review.yml&title=%5BREVIEW%5D+%3Ctitle%3E) (but no pressure).\r\n\r\nRe: swarmplots versus gather plots, I'd be curious to hear @nickelm's thoughts. Specifically for JoVI, it is worth mentioning that novelty is not a strict requirement (see [the validity section of the reviewer guidelines](https://www.journalovi.org/reviewer-guide.html#validity)), but we do expect folks to make contrasts with appropriate related work.\r\n",

					"body": "### Conflicts of interest\n\n- [X] I declare that I have no known conflicts of interest with the authors.\n\n### Review\n\nThis paper seeks to make constructing scatterplots less prone to overlap when using categorical axes. To do so, they introduce a method called gatherplot/gather transform. It involves a mechanism for two-dimensional partitioning and a series of layout algorithms for presenting unit visualizations within those partitions. The algorithms are three: absolute (which is a waffle plot-like layout), normalized (space-filling waffle plot), and stream graph (a specialization of absolute, it seems). This is evaluated via a series of examples (in figures) and a crowd-work study. Various design considerations are described, including combining the gatherplot with a magic lens style interaction (gather lens).\r\n\r\nThis is generally interesting work that seeks to solve a realistic problem; however, I think it is _currently_ a ways from being ready for publication. To wit, despite the clear enunciation of contributions provided in the introduction, I suggest that it is slightly ambiguous what is contributed in this work. It is suggested that there are four contributions:\r\n\r\n1: gather visual transform  \r\n2: gather plot chart type  \r\n3: gather lens\r\n4: the crowd work evaluation\r\n\r\n- I would argue that (1) is not a contribution made in this work, as it is simply the idea of data-based partitions (which is well known, as this is the idea of a data cube). In addition, as discussed below, some issues with that section's presentation impede its clarity.\r\n- While the inclusion of a magic lens is pretty interesting, I do not think it is a contribution in its current form. Why is this interaction particularly well matched with this chart type? The figure demonstrating this feature seems to show a scatterplot with substantial overlap, which would seem to suggest that it is not a gatherplot (but it is unclear). If these are not to be used in conjunction with gatherplots, then it would seem that this is a separate contribution and should be explored in its own context rather than taking the spotlight off gatherplots. Suggesting then that (3) is also yet to be a contribution.\r\n- I think the contribution of a new plot type is certainly interesting (2), and while gatherplot resembles many other chart types (for instance, bee swarm/swarm plots), they are unusual in their modularity. However, the particular evaluation strategy does not demonstrate this is a good chart relative to other chart types. It only shows that one mode (jitter) is less accurate than others, not that it is better than comparable chart types, nor does it enumerate what it can and can not do (see below for more about this). Similarly, an important idea with developing a chart type is that it makes it easy to conceptualize things for their users—things that might be difficult to do otherwise. It would be exciting to compare gatherplots as chart type against atom as a unit grammar.\r\n- It is also possible that the sub-algorithms (norm/abs/streamgraph) might be claimed as contributions. These are interesting algorithms, and the crowd-work study does approach evaluating them. However, there is also a very large space of additional algorithms that might be slotted into the gather transformation. For instance, in #4 @RaphaelWimmer asks about the relationship between this work and the somewhat well-known swarm plots. There are many forms of swarm plot, but [a prominent one](https://vega.github.io/vega/examples/beeswarm-plot/) involves using simple force-direction as means to create non-overlapping layouts. Other charts could be developed as well: for instance, nothing is stopping the partitions from containing things like unit-based pies or spirals and so on. It is not demonstrated that these are the best layout algorithms for this context or even really described what the space of possible charts might be (which would be an interesting contribution, although likely quite similar to atom).\r\n\r\nI think the main way in which InfoVis can build on this work is based on the result found in the user study that the normed/abs layouts are easier to use than just jitter—suggest perhaps a guideline that layouts other than jitter should be used, (which is a useful guideline that can be easily and directly applied elsewhere). However, the main body of the contribution (gatherplots) is somewhat under-evaluated. In addition, many components of the work that contribute to the overall construction need more care.\r\n\r\n_Evaluation_: I have some additional comments/questions about the evaluation.\r\n\r\n- what are the limitations of this approach? What can it do? What can it not do? In the current presentation, this isn't really reflected on (nor are the results of the study synthesized)\r\n- Given that this work seeks to be in dialog with scatterplots, I was surprised not to see usage of Sarikaya and Gleicher's \"Scatterplots: Tasks, Data, and Design\" task typology. Several tasks are described throughout (such as highlighting outliers), but these are not drawn from a single systemic task model. I would like to see a clear description of what tasks gatherplots (ideally in each mode) succeed and fail under such designs. This might more clearly allow the reader to understand the contribution of gatherplots.\r\n- I like that the presentation of the evaluation is fairly systematic. Could some of these points be combined in such a way that we get all of this information from a single chart? Similarly, I found it a little difficult to compare the algorithms in Figure 12, it'd be nice just to make 1 line per task (ideally with some context so we don't have to look up what the tasks are) and then pivot the algorithm by color and a small dy offset\r\n- How much were participants paid?\r\n- Was the stream plot tested? If not, why not?\r\n- I would like to see an example of the stimulus shown to participants in the paper. There's no space limit here! Please be generous with visual evidence.\r\n- I would like to see a direct comparison with/commentary on the author's own work atom. How does this compare to that? Can any of the algorithms in gatherplot be expressed as atom charts? Or does atom already do all of what this does? (Similarly there a large number of related charts mentioned in the related work, itd be useful to see a gallery of each of them trying to produce the same chart, to see how this form relates to those)\r\n- I am not evaluating the statistics applied in the evaluation; I leave that to a reviewer with greater expertise in that style of analysis.\r\n\r\n_Mathematical Rigor_: Section 3 attempts rigorously define the problem setting and proposed chart. I emphasize that I really like that the paper tries to be rigorous in its description, however, the level of rigor is far from sufficient and the resulting formalism is not used in the execution of the chart\r\nMajorly: the specific of the overlap definition is imprecise and allows for a wide variety of overlaps. For instance, it is not clear if mark size s refers to radius or diameter, each of which fails in various basic cases:\r\n\r\n![fig](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/assets/139371969/012b0866-945e-4167-b30c-9bc19ea8c108)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe radius case fails the test but is still clearly visible and should not be counted as overlapping as it can clearly be read, even at full opacity. Diameter case passes but clearly should fail as the center circle is totally overlapped. To make matters slightly more difficult, this definition is only applied _per dimension_. Overlaps in multiple dimensions may be more quarrelsome to catch points hidden by multi-dimensional overlaps (as above). In all, this makes this definition/test very, very brittle.\r\n\r\nMore minorly: many symbols in use are not defined or are hand-waved through. C is not defined, p_x is suggested as being a point, but this is not clearly defined, and D is not rigorously defined (for instance, what is its relationship with the rest of the data set?). The Describe corollary is not a corollary (in particular bc there have not been proofs), but also because it is a direct consequence of the definition used.\r\n\r\nGiven that this section has little consequence for the rest of the work, I recommend that it be removed. However, I would, of course, be happy to be wrong about the rigor of this measurement. This might be demonstrated empirically by measuring synthetic data sets with known amounts of overlap. (Similarly, I would like to see a visual argument of the \"using the gather transformation\" section and the \"segments as labeled intervals instead of labeled major and minor ticks\" in the preceding section. Claims are being made here, there should be evidence provided.)\r\n\r\nRelated\r\n\r\n- How does this definition handle varying-sized marks (can unit visualizations not encode size as one of their attributes? Perhaps \"Relaxed Dot Plots\" might make a point of comparison here?)\r\n- How does this handle not symmetric elements?\r\n\r\n_Misc_\r\n\r\n- I like that there is a certain amount of reasoning about how to effectively design with this chart type, but I wish that I found the arguments made in the visual design and interaction sections were more carefully argued. For instance, it suggested that stroke lines should be avoided all of the time, but this would seem to limit many designs needlessly. Why impose such a strict rule if it isn't necessary? It is noted that several alternate designs are considered for what mark to use, however the specifics of these design explorations are not discussed. Reciprocally, there is discussion of the interval tick marks, however the conclusion that 9f is the optimal design seems shallowly argued based on a notion of minimalism (which is itself debatable compared to 9e).\r\n- The axis folding interaction seems quite interesting, but it isn't evaluated (also, as a viewer, I expected it to fold to an aggregate? is it not creating visual distortion in its current form? )\r\n- I think it's part of the work's conceit that unit visualizations are worth considering, which I am willing to accept as a premise. However, the paper repeatedly dismisses aggregate marks as not being valuable, even though they are still plenty usable and unambiguous (such as in cluster views and so on). My favorite example of this usability is the Craigslist apartment finder, which uses clustering to great effect (although there are of course countless other examples). I would like to see a more careful argument why we should dismiss these forms out of hand.\r\n- A number of chart forms are dismissed in the intro/related work sections as they are unable to handle larger data, which is a flaw of this approach as well (for instance how would gatherplots deal with 1 million data points). Similarly, it is noted but not argued that changing \"mark size, increasing display space, or animating the data\" are not practical changes. It would be good to make these statements more careful.\r\n- It looks like this paper may be a resubmission from an earlier time. To be clear: there is nothing at all wrong with resubmitting something later. However, it also appears that the paper has not been updated in at least five years. While it is true that some things are timeless, part of rigorous work is to be in dialog with contemporary scholarship and relating the value of the work to those that came before it (or after it, as the case may be)—for instance, missing Sarikaya's scatterplot task model and all of the thoughtful empirical work that appears after it (or swarm plots!) seems like an oversight. Per the reviewer guidelines, I don't hold the authors to this point but merely note it.\r\n- There's a handful of typos throughout, some more confusing (\"Plotting the gives rise to diagonal line\"), some less (\"$p<0.01>$\", \"as (or ) in\"), but all should be fixed\r\n- It would be nice if there was a clear way for others to use this system outside of the provided interfaces. Consider extracting the layout algorithms somewhere reusable (like an npm package). I suggest that this type of engineering consideration helps supports the goals of openness held by this journal (what's more open then being able to try something yourself?), and so should be taken seriously. Related: it is noted in the preface that the system is implemented on observable. While I can see that this is true in the code for the article, providing a link to the observable notebook might be clearer, which I would imagine would be a more common way to interpret that assertion.\r\n- While I am intrigued by its inclusion, I don't quite understand why Firebase is a necessary component of this system. What properties of Firebase's real-time database are utilized? Is it just for hosting? If the latter, then it does not need to be listed as part of the implementation strategy.\r\n- Figure 5, in its pre-interaction state, may show an implementation bug (see below). It looks like it is saying that the vw rabbit custom is the whole axis when in fact, it's the name?\r\n\r\n![bugg](https://github.com/journalovi/2023-park-gatherplots/assets/139371969/beb6edaf-1b76-4a8e-84eb-d4b585bd6557)\r\n\r\n\n\n### Openness/Transparency\n\nRequired\r\n- An example of the stimuli used the crowd work study\r\n- The scripts used to produce the analysis\r\n\r\nNice to have\r\n- a way for others to use this approach (such as an npm library or observable chart type)\n\n### Submission categories\n\n- [ ] Registered Report\n- [ ] Replication Study\n- [ ] Empirical Research - Quantitative\n- [ ] Empirical Research - Qualitative\n- [X] Systems or design research\n- [ ] Commentary\n- [ ] Systematic Literature Review\n\n### Suggested outcome\n\nMajor revisions: this paper requires substantial improvements that I will need to re-review to decide whether or not to endorse it.\r\n\n\n### Requested changes\n\nMajor\r\n\r\n- Remove (or make rigorous) the overlap formalism\r\n- Remove (or more carefully argue) the design recommendations\r\n- Remove the discussion of gather lens, or, provide convincing evidence why this is unique to approach\r\n- Provide clearer comparison with other chart types or (preferably) clearly demonstrate what tasks can and can not be done with this chart type\r\n\r\nMinor\r\n\r\n- typos, presentational issues noted throughout\n\n### ORCID\n\n_No response_",

			"body": "> Just a small question for clarification: gatherplots look a lot like swarmplots - but they are never mentioned in the manuscript. Is this an oversight? I would really suggest to at least reference them.\r\n\r\nThanks for this feedback. It's a good point. I'm revising the paper at the moment and will push changes soon, but here is a preview of my response:\r\n\r\n> Stripplots [@stripplot-seaborn] and swarmplots [@swarmplot-seaborn], which are provided in the seaborn [@Waskom2021] statistical data visualization library for Python, are categorical scatterplots closely related to the gatherplots technique. Stripplots (the name is somewhat unfortunate as it clashes with the strip plots technique for rendering univariate data as strips, yielding a plot reminiscent of a barcode) are essentially scatterplots with random jittering where at least one axis is expected to be categorical. Swarmplots improve upon stripplots by displacing points to avoid overlap; based on the somewhat Brownian appearance of marks in a swarmplot, this is done by iteratively perturbing new points until there is no overlap. In comparison, gatherplots partition the available space into stacked groups and then organizes the marks inside each group into ordered grids. This yields a richer visual language that allows for sorting marks based on color and even resize marks to fill the visual space, as well as a more compact visual representation that makes better use of available space.\r\n\r\nAgain, thanks for the feedback. I have added citations to acknowledge seaborn and these plots (I could not find any earlier mention of them).",

			"body": "FWIW, I don't think swarmplot in seaborn is the earliest reference for beeswarms. I've tried finding it before and the earliest I can remember finding is the [beeswarm package in R](https://cran.r-project.org/package=beeswarm), which was first published in 2010 (seaborn was first published in 2013, far as I can tell). \r\n\r\nThe swarmplot layout in seaborn is also not particularly sophisticated --- in fact I believe this gives it too much credit:\r\n\r\n> Swarmplots improve upon stripplots by displacing points to avoid overlap; based on the somewhat Brownian appearance of marks in a swarmplot, this is done by iteratively perturbing new points until there is no overlap.\r\n\r\nI think it just sorts the points then places each point in sequence as close to the axis as it can given the placement of all prior points. That's why you get the somewhat undesirable \"lean\" in those plots. The beeswarm package implements better layout algorithms, like \"compactswarm\" (some examples later on [this page](https://github.com/eclarke/ggbeeswarm)); ggdist also allows the compactswarm layout (just called \"swarm\" there) as well as another layout called \"weave\" (see examples [here](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/articles/dotsinterval.html#layout)). There is further discussion of more sophisticated beeswarm layout algorithms [here](https://github.com/jtrim-ons/accurate-beeswarm-plot).\r\n\r\nAll that said, I think the fundamental contrast @nickelm raises is correct: the only two layouts I know of that maintain stacking order are dot histograms and Wilkinson-style dotplots. All the others sacrifice stacking order, usually to try to get more accurate x positions or a more pleasant-looking layout (or both).\r\n\r\n>  ... as well as a more compact visual representation that makes better use of available space.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I follow this claim; in my experience hexagonal layouts and compactswarm layouts will be a bit more compact than dot histograms or Wilkinson dotplots (though not by much really).",

			"body": "I stand corrected---thanks! I did some digging and rewriting; this is what I came up with:\r\n\r\n> Specialized versions of dot plots (Wilkinson 1999) have been imbued with their own monikers. The R graphics package presents a version called a stripchart, which allows for both jittering and stacking categorical data in a one-dimensional scatterplot. Beeswarm plots (Eklund and Trimble 2021) improves on stripcharts by allowing for closely packed, non-overlapping points. The seaborn (M. L. Waskom 2021) statistical data visualization library for Python extends these chart types to two-dimensional space. Stripplots (the name is somewhat unfortunate as it clashes with the strip plots technique for rendering univariate data as strips, yielding a plot reminiscent of a barcode) are 1D or 2D versions of stripcharts with random jittering where at least one axis is expected to be categorical. Swarmplots, on the other hand, are 2D versions of beeswarm plots that place points to avoid overlap. In comparison, gatherplots partition the available space into stacked groups and then organize the marks inside each group into ordered grids.
