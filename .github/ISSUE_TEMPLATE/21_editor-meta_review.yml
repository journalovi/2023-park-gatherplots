      Provide the Git commit hash for the version you are reviewing. You can find it as an alphanumeric string,
      like `de76cd7`, next to the latest commit on the main GitHub page for the paper (read more about commits
      in [the GitHub help](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits)).
      If you have checked out the project locally, you can also get the hash of the latest commit from the

      List the review issues you are summarizing as a bulleted list, one per line. This should include issues for
      Open Practices and Accessibility reviews, if applicable. For example:
      

      ```

      - #4
      
      - #6

      - #9

      Please summarize the reviews, justify your recommendation, and clearly indicate any required revisions. Consider:


      - how this paper advances our knowledge of InfoVis and/or HCI.

      - the credibility of the manuscriptâ€™s claims (if relevant).

      - the clarity of its evidence (if relevant).

      - if there are any areas of the paper you feel you do not have the expertise to review, if applicable.


      We do not prioritize novelty in the same way that e.g. VIS or CHI do. A replication study,
      for example, also advances our collective knowledge in that it either confirms or disputes
      previous findings.

    label: Decision
    description: >
      What is the most suitable next step for this submission? Note that we assume roughly
      1 month of turnaround time for minor revisions, and 3 months for major revisions (after the
      decision has been released to authors).


      Please keep in mind that we purposefully try to
      avoid the usual "one-shot" review process: we hope that you, as an editor, will guide this
      submission through the process and help the authors improve their paper to the point where
      it is a useful addition to the literature, even across several revisions if necessary.
      Unlike other venues, your reviews and comments will be published along with the paper and
      you will receive credit for them if you choose to sign the review.


      We are experimenting with an "endorsement" model on this track of JoVI.
      You will see that one of the options below is labeled "Endorse", which you can choose to
      recommend if you think that no further changes are required and you are ready to endorse this paper.
      The final decision of each reviewer to endorse or not endorse the paper will be published along with
      the paper. Authors can choose to "publish" the paper once the editor has endorsed it.


      Please use "**Reject**" sparingly, and only if you think there are severe
      methodological/ethical/technical flaws that cannot be addressed in a reasonable timeframe,
      or if the paper has not improved substantially over several revisions.
    options:
    -
    - >
        Endorse: I am willing to endorse this paper, with at most minor copyediting.
    - >
        Minor revisions: this paper requires some smaller changes, after which I am confident
        I would be able to endorse it.
    - >
        Major revisions: this paper requires substantial improvements that I will need to
        re-review to decide whether or not to endorse it.
    - >
        Reject: this paper cannot be fixed to the point where I would endorse it.
